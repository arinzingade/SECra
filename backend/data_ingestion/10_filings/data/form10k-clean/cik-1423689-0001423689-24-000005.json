    "item1": ">Item 1. Business \nAGNC Investment Corp. (\"AGNC,\" the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\") was organized on January\u00a07, 2008 and commenced operations on May\u00a020, 2008 following the completion of our initial public offering. Our common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"AGNC.\" \nWe are a leading provider of private capital to the U.S. housing market, enhancing liquidity in the residential real estate mortgage markets and, in turn, facilitating home ownership in the U.S. We invest primarily in Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (\"Agency RMBS\") on a leveraged basis. These investments consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac,\" and together with Fannie Mae, the \"GSEs\"), or by a U.S. Government agency, such as the Government National Mortgage Association (\"Ginnie Mae\"). We may also invest in other assets related to the housing, mortgage or real estate markets that are not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency.\nWe operate to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Internal Revenue Code\"). As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually 90% of our taxable income, and we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute all our annual taxable income to our stockholders on a timely basis. It is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year.\nWe are internally managed with the principal objective of generating favorable long-term stockholder returns with a substantial yield component. We generate income from the interest earned on our investments, net of associated borrowing and hedging costs, and net realized gains and losses on our investment and hedging activities. We fund our investments primarily through collateralized borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. \nInvestment Management Strategy\nWe employ an active management strategy that is dynamic and responsive to evolving market conditions. The composition of our portfolio and our investment, funding, and hedging strategies are tailored to reflect our analysis of market conditions and the relative values of available options. Our portfolio management philosophy is based upon the following core objectives:\n\u2022\ndeliver attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders primarily through monthly dividend distributions;\n\u2022\nmaintain an investment portfolio consisting predominantly of Agency RMBS;\n\u2022\ncapitalize on discrepancies in the relative valuations in the Agency and non-Agency securities market; \n\u2022\nmanage financing, interest rate, prepayment, extension and credit risks; \n\u2022\nqualify as a REIT; and \n\u2022\nremain exempt from the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \"Investment Company Act\").\nTargeted Investments\nAsset selection is a central component of our overall investment approach. Our investments consist predominantly of Agency RMBS which, in addition to carrying a GSE or U.S. Government guarantee against loss of principal, are considered a cornerstone of the U.S. financial system. The $9 trillion Agency market plays a vital role in providing liquidity to homeowners and prospective homeowners to purchase or refinance homes.  \nOur team of investment professionals has decades of experience investing in Agency RMBS. Our asset selection process involves assessing relative risk-return profiles against the backdrop of broader market conditions. Our team of investment professionals seeks to select assets with favorable underlying loan characteristics utilizing sophisticated modeling techniques to analyze each asset\u2019s risk profile and optimize returns over the life of the investment.  \nAgency Securities\n\u2022\nAgency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities. \nAgency RMBS consist of pass-through certificates representing interests in \"pools\" of mortgage loans secured by residential real property. Monthly payments of principal and interest made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans underlying the pools are in effect \"passed through\" to the security holders, after deducting guarantee and servicer fees. In general, mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among the security holders. Security holders also receive guarantor advances of principal and interest for delinquent loans in the mortgage pools. We may also \n2\ninvest in Agency collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\"), which are structured instruments backed by a pool of Agency mortgage-backed securities.\n\u2022\nTo-Be-Announced Forward Contracts (\"TBAs\"). \nTBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell Agency RMBS in the TBA market. TBA contracts specify the coupon rate, issuer, term and face value of the bonds to be delivered, with the actual bonds to be delivered only identified shortly before the TBA settlement date.\nNon-Agency Securities\n\u2022\nCredit Risk Transfer (\"CRT\") Securities. \nCRT securities are risk sharing instruments that transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses within pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or third- parties to private investors. Full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by the GSE or other third-party; rather, \"credit risk transfer\" is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT security if credit losses on the related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds. \n\u2022\nNon-Agency Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (\"Non-Agency RMBS\"). \nNon-Agency RMBS are structured securities backed by pools of residential mortgages packaged and issued by private institutions, such as a commercial bank or non-bank lender. Certain tranches of non-Agency RMBS may benefit from credit enhancement derived from structural elements, such as subordination, over-collateralization or insurance. We may purchase investment grade instruments that benefit from credit enhancement and non-investment grade instruments that are structured to absorb more credit risk. We focus primarily on non-Agency securities where the underlying mortgages are secured by residential properties within the United States, which may be comprised of prime, non-prime, qualified and non-qualified mortgage loans. \n\u2022\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities (\"CMBS\"). \nCMBS are securities backed by a pool of loans secured by one or more commercial properties. CMBS may also consist of a single loan for a single asset or multiple loans for a group of cross-collateralized assets of a single-borrower. CMBS are typically structured as multiple classes of securities where cash flows are distributed following a predetermined waterfall, which may give priority to selected classes while subordinating other classes. We may invest across the capital structure of these securities. We intend to focus on CMBS where the underlying collateral is secured by commercial properties located within the United States.\nFinancing Strategy\nOur investments in Agency RMBS benefit from asset-driven, as well as AGNC-specific, funding advantages, that enable us to enhance returns using leverage via low-cost and highly liquid collateralized borrowings structured as repurchase agreements.\nRepurchase agreements (\"repo\") involve the sale and a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the transferred assets at a future date. Our borrowings through repurchase transactions are generally short-term, with maturities typically ranging from one day to one year, but may sometimes have maturities of up to five or more years. Our financing rates are primarily impacted by short-term benchmark rates and liquidity in the Agency repo and short-term funding markets. \nThe amount of leverage that we utilize depends on market conditions, our assessment of risk and returns and our ability to borrow sufficient funds on favorable terms to acquire mortgage securities. We generally expect our leverage to be within six to twelve times the amount of our tangible stockholders' equity, but under certain conditions we may operate at leverage levels outside of this range. \nWe diversify our funding exposure by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple counterparties. We finance a portion of our investments through our wholly-owned captive broker-dealer subsidiary, Bethesda Securities, LLC (\"BES\"). BES is a member of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (\"FICC\") and has direct access to bilateral and tri-party repo funding as a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\") member broker-dealer. As an eligible institution, BES also raises repo funding through the General Collateral Finance (\"GCF\") Repo service offered by the FICC, with the FICC acting as the central counterparty. Thus, through BES, we have greater depth and diversity of funding than solely through traditional bilateral repo, while also lowering our funding cost, reducing our collateral requirements and limiting our counterparty exposure.\nWe also finance the acquisition of Agency RMBS by entering into TBA dollar roll transactions through which we simultaneously sell a TBA contract for the current month's settlement date and purchase a similar TBA contract for a forward month's settlement date. The TBA contract purchased for the forward settlement date is typically priced at a discount to the TBA contract sold for the current month. The discount, or \"price drop\", is the economic equivalent of interest income on the underlying Agency RMBS, less an implied financing cost, between the current month and forward month settlement dates. Prior to the forward settlement date, we may choose to roll the position to a later date by entering into an offsetting TBA \n3\nposition, net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously entering into a similar TBA contract for a new forward settlement date. Hence the discount or price drop from rolling TBA positions forward is commonly referred to as \"TBA dollar roll income.\" We recognize TBA contracts as derivative instruments on our consolidated financial statements at their net carrying value, which is their fair value less the purchase price to be paid or received under the TBA contract. Consequently, dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing. In evaluating our overall leverage, we consider both our on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financing.\nRisk Management Strategy \nAs a levered investor in fixed income securities, risk management is core to our business. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension, spread and credit risks. Our investment strategies are based on our assessment of these risks, our ability to hedge a portion of these risks and our intention to qualify as a REIT. We employ a variety of investment and risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to market risks, and we continuously monitor and adjust our hedge portfolio, the net duration (or interest rate sensitivity) of our investment portfolio, and leverage in order to optimize returns over the longer term as market conditions warrant.\nOur hedging strategies are generally not designed to protect our net book value from spread risk, which as a levered investor in mortgage-backed securities is the inherent risk we take that the spread between the market yield on our investments and the benchmark interest rates linked to our interest rate hedges fluctuates. In addition, although we attempt to protect our net book value against moves in interest rates, we may not fully hedge against interest rate, prepayment and extension risks if we believe that bearing such risks enhances our return profile, or if the hedging transaction would negatively impact our REIT status. Our risk management actions may lower our earnings and dividends in the short-term to further our objective of preserving our net book value and maintaining attractive levels of earnings and dividends over the long-term. In addition, some of our hedges are intended to provide protection against larger rate moves and as a result may be relatively ineffective for smaller interest rate changes. For additional explanation of our market risks please refer to Item 7A.\n Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \nand Item 1A.\n Risk Factors \nwithin this Form 10-K. \nRegulatory Requirements\nExemption from Regulation under the Investment Company Act \nWe conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Act. So long as we qualify for this exemption, we will not be subject to leverage and other restrictions imposed on registered investment companies, which would significantly reduce our ability to use leverage. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), requires us to invest at least 55% of our assets in \"mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate\" or \"qualifying real estate interests\" (\"55% asset test\") and at least 80% of our assets in qualifying real estate interests and \"real estate-related assets.\" In satisfying this 55% requirement, based on pronouncements of the SEC staff and in certain instances our own judgment, we treat Agency RMBS issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgage loans in which we hold all the certificates issued by the pool (\"whole pool\" securities) as qualifying real estate interests. We typically treat \"partial pool\" and other mortgage securities where we hold less than all the certificates issued by the pool as real estate-related assets. For additional information regarding our exemption under the Investment Company Act please refer to Item 1A.\n Risk Factors \nwithin this Form 10-K.\nReal Estate Investment Trust Requirements\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate income tax on our taxable income to the extent that we distribute annually all our taxable income to stockholders within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depend on our ability to continually meet requirements imposed upon REITs by the Internal Revenue Code, including satisfying certain organizational requirements, an annual distribution requirement and quarterly asset and annual income tests. The REIT asset and income tests are significant to our operations as they restrict the extent to which we can invest in certain types of securities and conduct certain hedging activities within the REIT. Consequently, we may be required to limit these activities or conduct them through a taxable REIT subsidiary (\"TRS\"). We believe that we have been organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT.\nIncome Tests:\nTo continue to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis.\n4\n1.\nAt least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year generally must be derived from investments in real property or mortgages on real property. \n2.\nAt least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year generally must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property. \nInterest income from obligations secured by mortgages on real property (such as Agency and non-Agency MBS) generally constitutes qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test described above. There is no direct authority with respect to the qualification of income or gains from TBAs for the 75% gross income test; however, we treat these as qualifying income for this purpose based on an opinion of legal counsel. The treatment of interest income from other real estate securities depends on their specific tax structure. Income and gains from instruments that we use to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings incurred, or to be incurred, to acquire real estate assets will generally be excluded from both gross income tests, provided that specified requirements are met. \nAsset Tests:\n \nAt the close of each calendar quarter, we must satisfy five tests relating to the nature of our assets.\n1.\nAt least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of \"real estate assets,\" cash, cash items, U.S. Government securities, and, under some circumstances, temporary investments in stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose, mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans are generally treated as \"real estate assets.\" Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test are subject to the additional asset tests described below. \n2.\nThe value of any one issuer's securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets.\n3.\nWe may not own more than 10% of any one issuer's outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities of TRSs and qualified REIT subsidiaries and the 10% asset test does not apply to \"straight debt\" having specified characteristics and to certain other securities.\n4.\nThe aggregate value of all securities of all TRSs that we hold may not exceed 20% of the value of our total assets.\n5.\nNo more than 25% of the total value of our assets may be represented by certain non-mortgage debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs (even though such debt instruments qualify under the 75% asset test).\nA failure to satisfy the income or asset tests would not immediately cause us to lose our REIT qualification; rather, we could retain our REIT qualification if we were able to satisfy certain relief provisions and pay any applicable penalty taxes and other fines, or, in the case of a failure to satisfy the asset test, eliminate the discrepancy within a 30-day cure period. Please also refer to the \"Risks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT\" in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors\" of this Form 10-K for further discussion of REIT qualification requirements and related items.\nRegulatory Requirements of our Captive Broker-Dealer Subsidiary\nBES is subject to ongoing membership and regulatory requirements as a member of the FICC and FINRA and as an SEC registered broker-dealer that include but are not limited to trade practices, use and safekeeping of funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping and conduct of directors, officers and employees. Additionally, as a self-clearing, registered broker-dealer, BES is subject to minimum net capital requirements. Thus, our ability to access tri-party repo funding through the FICC's GCF Repo service, which represents a significant portion of our total borrowing capacity, is reliant on BES' ability to continually meet FINRA and FICC regulatory and membership requirements.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe believe our success as a company ultimately depends on the strength, wellness, and dedication of our workforce. We pride ourselves on robust practices in the area of human capital management that are constantly evolving to meet the needs of our people. As of December 31, 2023, our workforce consisted of 53 full-time employees. We strive to provide each of our highly skilled employees an engaging, rewarding, supportive, and inclusive atmosphere in which to grow professionally. Our competitive and comprehensive benefits package is carefully designed to attract and retain talented personnel. We believe our \n5\nlow voluntary employee turnover and favorable employee survey results are a testament to the success of our human capital management initiatives. \nEmployee Turnover Metrics\nYear\nJanuary 1\nTerminations\n 1\nNew Hires\nDecember 31\n2023\n51\n\u2013\n2\n53\n2022\n50\n-2\n3\n51\n2021\n50\n-2\n2\n50\n________________________________\n1.\nEmployee t\nerminations include voluntary and involuntary terminations.\nEmployee Communications and Engagement\nWe recognize the importance of ongoing open communication and engagement with our employees, and we greatly value their input. We regularly engage with our employees in a variety of ways through ongoing direct engagement with each member of our staff, anonymous annual employee surveys and regular town hall meetings. Our anonymous employee surveys are an important component of our employee engagement that provide a means of assessing job satisfaction, engagement, and specific concerns of our employees. To enhance the candor and comfort of our employees, we use outside vendors that provide verbatim comments and analysis of engagement levels on an anonymous basis. In 2023, AGNC was recertified as a Great Place to Work\u2122 in recognition of employee engagement efforts. The prestigious certification was based entirely on feedback from employees through an extensive anonymous survey about their experiences working at AGNC, during which 96% of our employees said AGNC is a great place to work. Our Board and management use the results of our surveys and ongoing feedback to implement various ideas and recommendations received from employees.\nWorkplace Culture and Ethics\nOur corporate culture promotes open and honest communication, fair treatment, collegiality and high ethics and compliance standards. Our Code of Ethics and Conduct (\"Code of Conduct\") applies to all directors, officers and employees and provides clear expectations and guidance to facilitate appropriate decisioning. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as compliance with securities laws, conflicts of interest, giving and receiving gifts, discrimination, harassment, privacy, appropriate use of Company assets, protecting confidential information, and reporting Code of Conduct violations (including through an anonymous third-party hotline). All employees are required to affirm their understanding of these standards on at least an annual basis. We also regularly conduct mandatory compliance training on the Code of Conduct, insider trading, whistleblower protections, anti-harassment and other legal and corporate policies. Our executive officers and human resources department maintain \"open door\" policies, and any form of retaliation for bona fide reporting of Code of Conduct violations is expressly prohibited. \nEmployee Development\nWe have a number of policies and programs to further the professional development of our employees. These include our professional certification and continuing education policy, reimbursement for any supervisor-approved courses for our employees, and memberships to organizations, such as the Mortgage Bankers Association, which includes free access to educational webinars. We also conduct periodic \"Lunch and Learn\" seminars and offer a formal mentoring program for employees to receive direct one-on-one career guidance and cross-functional experience across various operations. Our employees also have the opportunity to lead and/or participate in employee-led initiatives, such as our employee-led Volunteerism & Community Outreach Committee, which is responsible for implementing and leading new volunteer opportunities, as well as identifying ways the Company can have a positive impact on the community. These initiatives have advanced unique and professional skill sets throughout the organization. \nDiversity and Inclusion\nCentral to our core values is that every individual deserves respect and equal treatment, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, cultural background or religious belief. We strive to have a diverse workforce and an inclusive and welcoming work environment that is free from wrongful discrimination. We have long maintained policies against discrimination and harassment in our workplace, and we periodically conduct workplace trainings and workshops attended by all employees related to these topics, including unconscious bias and anti-harassment training. Although we have a relatively small workforce and low turnover rate, our recruitment and hiring practices attempt to ensure the diversity of applicant pools for posted job openings. We also seek to engage our employees and provide them opportunities on a non-discriminatory and inclusive basis. As of December 31, 2023, 40% of our employees were women and 32% were ethnically diverse.\n6\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe seek to attract and retain the most talented employees in our industry by offering competitive compensation and benefits. Our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy is based on rewarding each employee\u2019s individual contributions through a combination of fixed and variable pay elements. Each employee receives a total compensation package that includes base salary, short-term incentives in the form of an annual cash bonus and long-term equity incentives in the form of time-vesting and/or performance-vesting restricted stock units. The proportion of each employee\u2019s variable incentive versus fixed-based elements of their compensation is directly correlated to the individual\u2019s level of responsibility and role in the organization. Generally, higher level employees have higher proportions of variable incentive-based compensation in their target mix. Similarly, within the incentive-based elements, the proportion of long-term incentive-based elements generally corresponds to the individual\u2019s role and level of responsibility in the organization.\nAs the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people, we offer benefits that support their physical, financial and emotional well-being. We provide our employees with access to flexible, comprehensive and convenient medical coverage intended to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In addition to standard medical coverage, we offer employees dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, parental leave and adoption assistance, voluntary short-term and long-term disability insurance, term life insurance, employee assistance programs, and other benefits. We also believe in the long-term financial wellness of our employees, and to foster maximum savings rates by our employees we offer a 401(k) Savings Plan with Company matching contributions of 100% up to 6% of each employee\u2019s eligible compensation, subject to IRS limits. \nCompetition \nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring mortgage assets, we compete with a variety of other investors, including other mortgage REITs, government entities, banks, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions, who may have competitive advantages over us as to the price they are willing to pay due to factors such as a lower cost of funds, access to funding sources not available to us or a lack of REIT and Investment Company Act regulatory constraints.\nCorporate Information \nOur executive offices are located at 7373 Wisconsin Avenue, 22\nnd\n Floor, Bethesda, MD 20814 and our telephone number is (301)\u00a0968-9315. \nWe make available our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports as well as our Code of Ethics and Conduct on our internet website at \nwww.AGNC.com. \nThese reports are also available on the SEC internet website at \nwww.sec.gov\n.",
    "item1a": ">Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto before deciding to purchase our securities. Any of the following risks could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If that happens, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or not presently deemed material by us, may also impair our operations and performance. Our risk factors discussed below are classified among:\n\u2022\nrisks related to our investment and portfolio management activities;\n\u2022\nrisks related to our financing and hedging activities;\n\u2022\nrisks related to our business operations;\n\u2022\nlegislative and regulatory risks; and\n\u2022\nrisks related to our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Investment and Portfolio Management Activities\nSpread risk is inherent to our business as a levered investor in Agency RMBS.\nWhen the market spread between the yield on our assets and the yield on benchmark interest rates linked to our interest rate hedges widens, our tangible net book value will typically decline. We refer to this as \"spread risk\". As a levered investor primarily in fixed-rate Agency RMBS, spread risk is an inherent component of our business. Although we use hedging instruments to attempt to protect against moves in interest rates, our hedges will typically not protect us against spread risk. \n7\nSpreads may widen due to numerous factors, including due to actual or expected monetary policy actions by U.S. and foreign central banks, increased market volatility, increased available supply of Agency RMBS, a decline in market liquidity and changes in investor return requirements and sentiment.\nInterest rate and spread volatility represent significant risks to our business, potentially affecting our liquidity, increasing our costs, and impacting our ability to manage risks effectively.\nInterest rate and spread volatility can have profound impacts on our business, financial condition, and operating results in several ways. Such volatility amplifies market-based risks, affecting asset and liability values and potentially leading to less earnings stability. Volatility increases our exposure to margin calls, including higher risk-based margin requirements, typically requiring us to post additional collateral, which could reduce our unencumbered liquidity and limit resources available for operational needs and further margin requirements. The complexity and cost of hedging against interest rate fluctuations also rises with volatility, potentially impacting our profitability. \nVolatility can also reduce liquidity in the mortgage market as mortgage investors reduce their exposure to this risk, making it more challenging to buy or sell assets without affecting their market price. Volatility may also reduce the effectiveness and accuracy of the predictive models that we use to aid in our decision-making and risk management.\nIn summary, interest rate and spread volatility represent significant risks to our business, potentially affecting our liquidity, increasing our costs, and impacting our ability to manage risks effectively. We continuously monitor these conditions and adjust our strategies accordingly, but there is no guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to mitigate the adverse effects of volatility on our operations and financial results.\nThe Fed\u2019s participation in the Agency mortgage market could have an adverse effect on our Agency RMBS investments.\nThe Federal Reserve's (the \u201cFed\u201d) participation in the Agency RMBS market can have a material impact on the mortgage market, altering the available supply, price and returns on Agency RMBS. Its involvement in the mortgage market can result in increased market volatility and amplify the effects of market-related risks on our financial condition. Generally, when the Fed conducts large-scale asset purchases, Agency RMBS values increase and mortgage spreads tighten. This scenario results in an increase in our tangible net book value, although the return potential on new asset purchases typically declines. Conversely, actual or anticipated reductions of Fed asset purchases or its outright sale of assets, would generally be expected to result in a decline in asset values and wider mortgage spreads to benchmark interest rates, reducing our tangible net book value, while increasing the return potential on new asset purchases. \nThe Fed first used large-scale asset purchases of U.S. Treasury securities and Agency RMBS, known as quantitative easing, or QE, during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis in an attempt to stabilize financial markets and stimulate a sustained economic recovery. In its most recent QE round, resulting from the Covid-19 financial crisis, the Fed\u2019s balance sheet more than doubled from $4.2 trillion in March 2020 to $8.9 trillion in May 2022. This included a significant increase in its Agency RMBS holdings, to nearly a third of all outstanding Agency RMBS by the time the Fed announced its intention to end QE and commence monetary tightening by, among other actions, gradually reducing its holdings of Agency RMBS over time by not reinvesting proceeds of principal repayments, subject to monthly caps.\nSince the beginning of the Fed's current monetary tightening cycle in 2022, through fiscal year-end 2023, the Fed has reduced its Agency RMBS holdings by approximately $300 billion through mortgage prepayment activity. Although the Fed currently favors a gradual reduction of its balance sheet through prepayment activity, subject to monthly caps, there is no guarantee that it will not conduct outright asset sales in the future or alter its monthly caps. If the Fed were to conduct assets sales or allow a more rapid unwinding of its balance sheet than anticipated, Agency RMBS markets could experience increased market volatility, reduced liquidity and an increase in Agency RMBS spreads to benchmark interest rates, causing a material decline in our tangible net book and negatively impacting our financial position.  \nOur active portfolio management strategy may expose us to greater losses and lower returns than compared to passive strategies.\nWe employ an active management strategy; therefore, the composition of our investment portfolio, leverage ratio and hedge composition will vary as we believe changes to market conditions warrant. We may realize significant investment gains or losses when we sell investments that we no longer believe provide attractive risk-adjusted returns or when we believe more attractive alternatives are available. We may also be incorrect in our assessment of market conditions and select an investment portfolio, leverage levels and terms, and hedge composition that generate lower returns than a more static management strategy. Furthermore, because of our active strategy, investors may be unable to assess changes in our financial position solely by observing changes in the mortgage market. \n8\nA decline in the fair value of our assets may adversely affect our financial condition and make it costlier to finance our assets.\nOur investment securities are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair value reported in net income or other comprehensive income. Therefore, a decline in the fair value of our assets reduces our total comprehensive income and adversely affects our financial position. We use our investments as collateral for our financing arrangements and certain hedge transactions; consequently, a decline in fair value, or perceived market uncertainty about the value of our assets, could reduce the amount of our unencumbered assets, subject us to margin calls and could make it more difficult for us to maintain our compliance with the terms of our financing agreements, and it could reduce our ability to purchase additional investments or to renew or replace our existing borrowings as they mature. As a result, we could be required to sell assets at adverse prices and our ability to maintain or grow our total comprehensive income could be reduced.\nThe value of our assets is influenced by multiple factors. The value of our long-term fixed rate securities is particularly impacted by fluctuations in longer-term interest rates. Additionally, market liquidity can significantly impact asset values, where a decrease in liquidity can lead to a decline in asset values and increased price volatility. Factors that can reduce market liquidity include shifts in macro-economic conditions, market uncertainties, changes in investor sentiment, a decline in or negative global money flows to the U.S. fixed income markets, and regulatory capital requirements that constrain the market-making or funding capabilities of banks and financial institutions. Fed monetary policy and the pace of its balance sheet reduction could also negatively impact asset values and market liquidity, especially if this unwinding process occurs more rapidly than anticipated.\nChanges in prepayment rates may adversely affect the return on our investments.\nOur investment portfolio includes securities backed by pools of mortgage loans, which receive payments related to the underlying mortgage loans. When borrowers prepay their mortgage loans at rates faster or slower than anticipated, it exposes us to prepayment or extension risk. Generally, prepayments increase during periods of falling mortgage interest rates and decrease during periods of rising mortgage interest rates, but other factors can also affect the rate of prepayments, including loan age and size, loan-to-value ratios, housing price trends, general economic conditions and GSE buyouts of delinquent loans.\nIf our assets prepay at a faster rate than anticipated, we may be unable to reinvest the repayments at acceptable yields. If the proceeds are reinvested at lower yields than our existing assets, our net interest margins would be negatively impacted. We also amortize or accrete into interest income any premiums and discounts we pay or receive at purchase relative to the stated principal of our assets over their projected lives using the effective interest method. If the actual and estimated future prepayment experience differs from our prior estimates, we are required to record an adjustment to interest income for the impact of the cumulative difference in the effective yield, which could negatively affect our interest income.\nIf our assets prepay at a slower rate than anticipated, our assets could extend beyond their expected maturity, and we may have to finance our investments at potentially higher costs without the ability to reinvest principal into higher yielding securities. Additionally, if prepayment rates decrease due to a rising interest rate environment, the average life or duration of our fixed-rate assets would extend, but our interest rate swap maturities would remain fixed and, therefore, cover a smaller percentage of our funding exposure. At the same time, the market value of our assets could decline, while most of our hedging instruments would not receive any incremental offsetting gains.\nTo the extent that actual rates of prepayment differ from our expectations, our operating results could be adversely affected, and we could be forced to sell assets to maintain adequate liquidity, which could cause us to incur realized losses. In addition, should significant prepayments occur, there is no certainty that we will be able to identify acceptable new investments, which could reduce our invested capital or result in us investing in less favorable securities.\nPrepayment rates are difficult to predict, and market conditions and other factors impacting mortgage origination channels may disrupt the historical correlation between interest rate changes and prepayment trends.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to predict prepayment behavior over a variety of economic conditions. As part of our overall portfolio risk management, we analyze interest rate changes and prepayment trends to assess their effects on our investment portfolio. Our analysis is largely based on predictive models and reliance on historical correlations between interest rates and other factors and the rate of prepayments. However, unprecedented events, market dislocations, advances in origination channel technologies and other factors may impair the usefulness of these historical correlations or render them completely invalid, reducing our ability to accurately predict future prepayment activity. Other factors beyond interest rates also impact the rate of prepayments and may be difficult to predict, such as housing turnover, lending conditions and the availability of credit to homeowners, and GSE buyouts of delinquent loans from the underlying mortgage pool.\n9\nThe analytical models and third-party data that we rely on to manage our portfolio and conduct our business objectives may be incorrect, misleading or incomplete.\nWe use analytical models, data and other information to value our assets and assess potential investment opportunities in connection with our risk management and hedging activities. We may source our models and data from third-parties or develop them internally. Models are dependent on multiple assumptions and inputs. Models typically also assume a static portfolio. If either the models, their underlying assumptions or data inputs prove to be incorrect, misleading or incomplete, any decisions we make in reliance on such information may be faulty and expose us to potential risks. \nMany of the analytical models we use are predictive in nature, such as mortgage prepayment and default models. The use of predictive models has inherent risks and may incorrectly forecast future behavior, leading to potential losses. Furthermore, since predictive models are usually constructed based on historical trends using data supplied by third parties, the success of relying on such models depends heavily on the accuracy and reliability of the supplied historical data. Additionally, multiple factors could disrupt the relationships between data and historical trends, reducing the ability of our models to predict future outcomes, or even render them invalid. We are at greater risk of this occurring during periods of high volatility or unanticipated and/or unprecedented financial or economic events, including any actual or anticipated shifts in Fed policy resulting from these events. Consequently, actual results could differ materially from our projections. Moreover, use of different models could result in materially different projections.\nAnalytical models and third-party data used to analyze credit sensitive assets also expose us to the risk that the (i) collateral cash flows and/or liability structures may be incorrectly modeled, or may be modeled based on simplifying assumptions that lead to errors; (ii) information about collateral may be incorrect, incomplete or misleading; (iii) collateral or bond historical performance (such as historical prepayments, defaults, cash flows, etc.) may be incorrectly reported, or subject to interpretation (e.g., different issuers may report delinquency statistics based on different definitions of what constitutes a delinquent loan); or (iv) collateral or bond information may be outdated, in which case the models may contain incorrect assumptions as to what has occurred since the date information was last updated.\nThe fair value of our investments may not be readily determinable or may be materially different from the value that we ultimately realize upon their disposal.\nWe measure the fair value of our investments in accordance with guidance set forth in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures\n. Fair value is only an estimate based on good faith judgment of the price at which an investment can be sold since market prices of investments can only be determined by negotiation between a willing buyer and seller. Our determination of the fair value of our investments includes inputs provided by pricing services and third-party dealers. Valuations of certain investments in which we invest may be difficult to obtain or unreliable. In general, pricing services and dealers heavily disclaim their valuations and we do not have recourse against them in the event of inaccurate price quotes or other inputs used to determine the fair value of our investments. Depending on the complexity and illiquidity of a security, valuations of the same security can vary substantially from one pricing source to another. Moreover, values can fluctuate significantly, even over short periods of time. For these reasons, the fair value at which our investments are recorded may not be an accurate indication of their realizable value. The ultimate realization of the value of an asset depends on economic and other conditions that are beyond our control. Consequently, if we were to sell an asset, particularly through a forced liquidation, the realized value may be less than the amount at which the asset is recorded, which would negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe mortgage loans referenced by our CRT securities or that underlie our non-Agency securities may be or could become subject to delinquency or foreclosure, which could result in significant losses to us.\nInvestments in credit-oriented securities, such as CRT securities and non-Agency MBS, where repayment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency, subject us to the potential risk of loss of principal and/or interest due to delinquency, foreclosure and related losses on the underlying mortgage loans.\nCRT securities are risk sharing instruments issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and similarly structured transactions arranged by third-party market participants, that are designed to synthetically transfer mortgage credit risk from the issuing entity to private investors. The transactions are structured as unguaranteed bonds whose principal payments are determined by the delinquency and prepayment experience of a reference pool of mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. An investor in CRT securities bears the risk that the borrowers in the reference pool of loans may default on their obligations to make full and timely payments of principal and interest. \nNon-Agency RMBS are backed by residential mortgage loans, which carry the risk of delinquency, foreclosure and loss based on the borrower's ability to repay. The ability to repay is primarily influenced by the borrower's income and assets. Factors such as loss of employment, divorce, illness, acts of God, acts of war or terrorism, adverse changes in economic and \n10\nmarket conditions, declining home values, changes in laws and regulations, changes in fiscal policies and zoning ordinances, environmental hazards such as mold, and property losses (insured or not) can impede repayment.\nCMBS are backed by commercial loans, secured by multifamily or other commercial properties. These loans typically face higher risks of delinquency and loss compared to residential loans. Repayment largely depends on the property's operational success. Factors affecting the property's net operating income, such as occupancy rates, tenant mix, the success of tenant businesses, property management, location, condition, and economic conditions, can influence the borrower's repayment capacity.\nGeographic concentration of our assets can heighten the risk of default and loss. Both borrower repayment and the market value of the assets underlying our investments are affected by national, local and regional economic conditions. As a result, concentrations of investments tied to geographic regions increase the risk that adverse conditions affecting a region could increase the frequency and severity of losses on our investments. Additionally, assets in certain regional areas may be more susceptible to certain environmental hazards (such as earthquakes, widespread fires, rising sea levels, disease, floods, drought, hurricanes and certain climate risks) than properties in other areas; for example, assets located in coastal states may be more susceptible to hurricanes or sea level rise than properties in other parts of the country. Areas affected by these types of events often experience disruptions in travel, transportation and tourism, loss of jobs, a decrease in consumer activity, and a decline in real estate-related investments, and their economies may not recover sufficiently to support income producing real estate at pre-event levels. These types of occurrences may increase over time or become more severe due to changes in weather patterns and other climate changes.\nPrivate mortgage insurance may not cover losses on loans referenced by our CRT securities and underlying our non-Agency RMBS.\nIn certain instances, mortgage loans referenced by our CRT securities or underlying our non-Agency RMBS may have private mortgage insurance. However, this insurance may not cover some or all of our potential loss if a loan defaults. This may occur, for example, because it is frequently structured to absorb only a portion of the loss; the insurance provider rescinds or denies coverage; or the insurer's failure to satisfy its obligations under the insurance contract, whether due to breach of contract or to an insurer's insolvency.\nChanges in credit spreads may adversely affect our profitability.\nA significant component of the fair value of CRT and non-Agency securities and other credit risk-oriented investments is attributable to the credit spread, or the difference between the value of the credit instrument and the value of a financial instrument with similar interest rate exposure, but with no credit risk, such as a U.S. Treasury note. Credit spreads can be highly volatile and may fluctuate due to changes in economic conditions, liquidity, investor demand and other factors. Credits spreads typically widen in times of increased market uncertainty or when economic conditions have or are expected to deteriorate. Credit spreads may also widen due to actual or anticipated rating downgrades on the securities or similar securities. Hedging fair value changes associated with credit spreads can be inefficient and our hedging strategies are generally not designed to mitigate credit spread risk. Consequently, changes in credit spreads could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to acquire desirable investments due to competition, a reduction in the supply of new production Agency RMBS having the specific attributes we seek, and other factors.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to acquire our target assets at attractive prices. We may seek assets with specific attributes that affect their propensity for prepayment under certain market conditions or enable us to satisfy asset test requirements to maintain our REIT qualification status or exemption from regulation under the Investment Company Act (such as \"whole pool\" Agency RMBS). The supply of our target assets may be impacted by policies and procedures adopted by the GSEs, such as pooling practices, or their regulator, the FHFA, or actions by other governmental agencies. Housing finance reform measures may also impact the supply and availability of our target assets. Consequently, a sufficient supply of our target assets may not be available or available at attractive prices. We may also compete for these assets with a variety of other investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, government entities, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, who may have competitive advantages over us, such as a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources not available to us. If we are unable to acquire a sufficient supply of our target assets, we may be unable to achieve our investment objectives or to maintain our REIT qualification status or exemption from regulation under the Investment Company Act. \n11\nWe may change our targeted investments, investment guidelines and other operational policies without stockholder consent.\nWe may change our targeted investments and investment guidelines at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments that are different from, and possibly riskier than, those described in this Annual Report or under our current guidelines. We may also amend or revise our other operational policies, including our policies with respect to our REIT qualification, acquisitions, dispositions, operations, indebtedness and distributions without a vote of, or notice to, our stockholders. Any such change may increase our exposure to risks described herein or expose us to new risks that are not currently contemplated, which could materially impair our operations and financial performance.\nRisks Related to Our Financing and Hedging Activities\nOur strategy involves the use of significant leverage, which increases the risk that we may incur substantial losses.\nWe expect our leverage to vary with market conditions and our assessment of the tradeoffs between risk and return on investments. We generally expect to maintain our leverage between six to twelve times the amount of our tangible stockholders' equity, but we may operate at levels outside of this range for extended periods. We incur this leverage by borrowing against a substantial portion of the market value of our assets. Leverage, which is fundamental to our investment strategy, creates significant risks and amplifies our risk exposure to higher borrowing costs, changes in underlying asset values, changes in mortgage spreads, and other market factors. Leverage also exposes us to the risk of margin calls and defaults under our funding agreements, which may result in forced sales of assets in adverse market conditions. The risks associated with leverage are more acute during volatile market environments and periods of reduced market liquidity. Because of our leverage, we may incur substantial losses.\nWe may be unable to procure or renew funding on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe rely primarily on short-term borrowings to finance our mortgage investments. Consequently, our ability to achieve our investment objectives depends not only on our ability to borrow sufficient amounts and on favorable terms, but also our ability to renew or replace our maturing short-term borrowings on a continuous basis. A variety of factors could prevent us from being able to achieve our intended borrowing and leverage objectives, including:\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the repo market generally or the infrastructure that supports it;\n\u2022\nhigher short-term interest rates;\n\u2022\na decline in the market value of our investments available to collateralize borrowings; \n\u2022\nincreases in the \"haircut\" lenders require on the value of our assets under repurchase agreements, resulting in higher collateral requirements; \n\u2022\nincreases in member specific margin requirements assessed by the FICC for tri-party repo accessed by our wholly-owned captive broker-dealer subsidiary, BES, through the FICC's GCF Repo service;\n\u2022\nregulatory capital requirements or other limitations imposed on our lenders that negatively impact their ability or willingness to lend to us;\n\u2022\nan exit by lenders from the market;\n\u2022\ncircumstances that could result in our failure to satisfy covenants, leverage limits, or other requirements imposed by our lenders, in which case our lenders may terminate and cease entering into repurchase transactions with us; and \n\u2022\nthe inability of BES to continually meet FINRA and FICC regulatory and membership requirements, which may change over time.\nBecause of these and other factors, there is no assurance that we will be able to secure financing on terms that are acceptable to us. If we cannot obtain sufficient funding on acceptable terms, we may have to sell assets possibly under adverse market conditions.\nOur borrowing costs may increase at a faster pace than the yield on our investments.\nOur borrowing costs are particularly sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates, as well as overall funding availability and market liquidity, whereas the yield on our fixed rate assets is largely influenced by longer-term rates and conditions in the mortgage market. Consequently, our borrowing costs may rise at a faster pace or decline at a slower pace than the yield on our assets, negatively impacting our net interest margin. \nIt may be uneconomical to roll our TBA dollar roll transactions and we may be required to take physical delivery of the underlying securities and fund our obligations with cash or other financing sources.\nWe utilize TBA dollar roll transactions as an alternate means of investing in and financing Agency RMBS, which represent a form of off-balance sheet financing and increase our \"at risk\" leverage. It may become uneconomical for us to roll forward our TBA positions prior to their settlement dates due to market conditions, which can be impacted by a variety of \n12\nfactors including the Fed\u2019s purchases and sales of Agency RMBS in the TBA market. TBA dollar roll transactions include a deferred purchase price obligation on our part. An inability or unwillingness to continue to roll forward our position has effects similar to a termination of financing. In that circumstance, we would be required to settle the obligations for cash and would then take physical delivery of the underlying Agency RMBS. We may not have sufficient funds or alternative financing sources available to settle such obligations. Additionally, if we take delivery of the underlying securities, we can expect to receive the \"cheapest to deliver\" securities with the least favorable prepayment attributes that satisfy the terms of the TBA contract. Further, the specific securities that we receive may include few, if any, \u201cwhole pool\u201d securities, which could inhibit our ability to remain exempt from and regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act (see \n\u201cLoss of our exemption from regulation pursuant to the Investment Company Act would adversely affect us\u201d\n below). TBA contracts also subject us to margin requirements as described further below. Our inability to roll forward our TBA positions or failure to obtain adequate financing to settle our obligations or to meet margin calls under our TBA contracts could force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions causing us to incur significant losses. \nOur funding and derivative agreements subject us to margin calls that could result in defaults and force us to sell assets under adverse market conditions or through foreclosure.\nOur funding and derivative agreements require that we maintain certain levels of collateral with our counterparties and may result in margin calls initiated against us if, for example, the value of our collateral declines. A margin call means that the counterparty requires us to pledge additional collateral to re-establish the required collateral level to protect them from loss in the event we default on our obligations. The requirement to meet margin calls can create liquidity risks. In the event of a margin call, we must generally provide additional collateral on the same business day. If we fail to meet the margin call, we would be in default, and our counterparty could terminate outstanding transactions, require us to settle our entire obligation under the agreement and enforce their interests against existing collateral. Furthermore, we may also be subject to certain cross-default and acceleration rights, such that if we were to fail to meet a margin call under one agreement that failure could lead to defaults, accelerations, or other adverse events under other agreements, as well. The threat or occurrence of margin calls or the accelerated settlement of our obligations under our agreements could force us to sell our investments under adverse market conditions and result in substantial losses.\nOur fixed-rate collateral is generally more susceptible to margin calls due to its price sensitivity to changes in interest rates. In addition, some collateral may be less liquid than other instruments, which could cause it to be more susceptible to margin calls in a volatile market environment. Additionally, faster rates of prepayment increase the magnitude of potential margin calls as there is a time lag between the effective date of the prepayment and when we receive the principal payment. \nOur derivative agreements also subject us to margin calls. Collateral requirements under our derivative agreements are typically dictated by contract or clearinghouse rules and regulations adopted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and regulators of other countries. Thus, changes in clearinghouse rules and other regulations can increase our margin requirements and the cost of our hedges. Our counterparties typically have the sole discretion to determine eligible collateral, the value of our collateral and, in the case of our derivative counterparties, the value of our derivative instruments. Additionally, for cleared swaps and futures, the futures commission merchant, or FCM, that we transact through typically has the right to require more collateral than the clearinghouse requires. \nChanges to FICC margin requirements could limit our ability to enter tri-party repo transactions with the FICC\u2019s GCF Repo service and TBA transactions with the FICC\u2019s MBSD\nWe finance a significant portion of our investments and execute TBA transactions through our wholly-owned captive broker-dealer subsidiary, BES. As an eligible institution, BES accesses repo funding through the FICC\u2019s GCF Repo service and central clearing in the TBA market through the FICC's Mortgage-Backed Securities Division (MBSD). \nThe FICC continually assesses potential changes to rules governing the calculation of margin and minimum margin requirements. The FICC may also levy member specific margin requirements, including requirements related to a member's specific portfolio risk factors as a ratio to that member\u2019s net capital, requirements related to \"back-testing\" failures of collected FICC margin requirements to cover losses from a simulated liquidation of a member\u2019s portfolio, and other charges that the FICC has the ability to implement, in some cases without a significant notice period. \nIncreases in FICC margin requirements would have the effect of reducing our unencumbered assets and could potentially limit our ability to utilize tri-party repo funding through the FICC's GCF Repo service and engage in centrally-cleared TBA transactions through the FICC\u2019s MBSD. Furthermore, BES' inability to meet FICC margin requirements may result in the FICC declaring an event of default and ceasing to act for BES as a member along with a liquidation of any margin collateral as well as the portfolio of outstanding transactions for which the FICC serves as BES\u2019 central counterparty, potentially in adverse market conditions. If BES were to fail to continually meet FICC margin requirements and default on its obligations to the FICC it could have a material financial impact on our financial position.\n13\nOur repurchase agreements and agreements governing certain derivative instruments may contain financial and nonfinancial covenants subjecting us to the risk of default. \nOur bilateral repurchase agreements and certain derivative agreements require that we comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants. Our more restrictive financial covenants typically limit declines in our stockholders\u2019 equity for any given quarter, calendar year, or 12-month period and limit our leverage to a maximum amount. Compliance with these covenants depends on market factors and the strength of our business and operating results. In addition, our agreements typically require, among other things, that we maintain our status as a publicly listed REIT and to be exempted from the provisions of the 1940 Act. Various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control, including significant fluctuations in interest rates, market volatility and changes in market conditions, could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Unless we were able to negotiate a waiver or forbearance of such covenants, failure to comply with them could result in an event of default and generally would give the counterparty the right to exercise certain other remedies under the agreement, including termination of one or more repo or hedging transactions, acceleration of all amounts owed under an agreement, and the right to sell the collateral held by that counterparty. Any waiver or forbearance, if granted, could carry additional conditions that may be unfavorable to us. Additionally, certain of our agreements contain cross-default, cross-acceleration or similar provisions, such that if we were to violate a covenant under one agreement, that violation could lead to defaults, accelerations, or other adverse events under other agreements, as well.\nOur rights under repurchase and derivative agreements in the event bankruptcy or insolvency may be limited.\nIn the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency, our repurchase agreements and hedging arrangements may qualify for special treatment under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the effect of which, among other things, would be to allow the counterparty under the applicable agreement to avoid the automatic stay provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and to foreclose on the collateral without delay. In the event of an insolvency or bankruptcy of one of our repurchase agreement or derivative counterparties, the counterparty may be permitted, under applicable insolvency laws, to repudiate the contract, and our claim against the counterparty for damages may be treated simply as an unsecured creditor. In addition, if the counterparty is a broker or dealer subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, or an insured depository institution subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, our ability to recover our assets under our agreements or to be compensated for any damages resulting from the counterparty's insolvency may be further limited by those statutes. Recoveries on these claims could be subject to significant delay and, if received, could be substantially less than the damages incurred.\nOur funding and derivative agreement counterparties may not fulfill their obligations to us as and when due.\nIf a repurchase agreement counterparty defaults on its obligation to resell collateral to us, we could incur a loss on the transaction equal to the difference between the value of our collateral and the amount of our borrowing. Similarly, if a derivative agreement counterparty fails to return collateral to us at the conclusion of the derivative transaction or fails to pledge collateral to us or to make other payments we are entitled to under the terms of our agreement as and when due, we could incur a loss equal to the value of our collateral and other amounts due to us.\nWe attempt to limit our counterparty exposure by diversifying our funding across multiple counterparties and limiting our counterparties to registered central clearing exchanges and major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. However, these measures may not sufficiently reduce our risk of loss. Central clearing exchanges typically attempt to reduce the risk of default by requiring initial and daily variation margin from their clearinghouse members and maintain guarantee funds and other resources that are available in the event of default. Nonetheless, we could be exposed to a risk of loss if an exchange or one or more of its clearing members defaults on its obligations. Most of the swaps and futures transactions that we enter into must be cleared by a Derivatives Clearing Organization, or DCO. DCOs are subject to regulatory oversight, use extensive risk management processes, and might receive \"too big to fail\" support from the government in the case of insolvency. We access the DCO through several FCMs, which may establish their own collateral requirements beyond that of the DCO. Consequently, for any cleared swap or futures transaction, we bear the credit risk of both the DCO and the relevant FCM as to obligations under our swap and futures agreements. The enforceability of our derivative and repurchase agreements may also depend on compliance with applicable statutory, commodity and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the domicile of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. \nOur hedging strategies may be ineffective.\nWe attempt to limit, or hedge against, the adverse effect of changes in interest rates on the value of our assets and financing costs, subject to complying with REIT tax requirements. Hedging strategies are complex and do not fully protect against adverse changes under all circumstances. Our business model also calls for accepting certain amounts of risk. Consequently, our hedging activities are generally designed to limit interest rate exposure, but not to eliminate it, and they are generally not designed to hedge against spread risk and other risks inherent to our business model.\n14\nOur hedging strategies may vary in scope based on our portfolio composition, liabilities and our assessment of the level and volatility of interest rates, expected prepayments, credit and other market conditions, and are expected to change over time. We could fail to properly assess a risk or fail to recognize a risk entirely, leaving us exposed to losses without the benefit of any offsetting hedges. Furthermore, the techniques and derivative instruments we select may not have the effect of reducing our risk. Poorly designed hedging strategies or improperly executed transactions could increase our risk of loss. Hedging activities could also result in losses if the hedged event does not occur. Numerous other factors can impact the effectiveness of our hedging strategies, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe cost of interest rate hedges;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which the interest rate hedge benchmark rate correlates to the interest rate risk being hedged; \n\u2022\nthe degree to which the duration of the hedge matches that of the related asset or liability, particularly as interest rates change;\n\u2022\nthe amount of income that a REIT may earn from hedging transactions that do not satisfy certain requirements of the Internal Revenue Code or that are not done through a TRS; and\n\u2022\nthe degree to which the value of our interest rate hedges changes relative to our assets as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, passage of time, or other factors.\nAdditionally, regulations adopted by the CFTC and regulators of other countries could adversely affect our ability to engage in derivative transactions or impose increased margin requirements and require additional operational and compliance costs. Consequently, our hedging strategies may fail to protect us from loss and could even result in greater losses than if we had not entered in the hedge transaction.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur executive officers and other key personnel are critical to our success and the loss of any executive officer or key employee may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe operate in a highly specialized industry and our success is dependent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, skill and network of business contacts of our executive officers and key personnel. The departure of any of our executive officers and/or key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and performance.\nWe are highly dependent on information systems and third-party service providers to conduct our operations, and system failures, cybersecurity incidents or failure of our providers to fulfill their obligations to us could significantly disrupt our ability to operate our business. \nOur business heavily depends on information and communication systems, including services provided by third parties and cloud-based platforms. A failure in these systems, or a failure by a third-party provider, could significantly disrupt our operations. These systems may be subject to damage or interruption from, among other things, natural disasters, public health issues such as pandemics or epidemics, terrorist attack, rogue employees, power loss, telecommunications failures, internet disruptions, and other interruptions beyond our control. Additionally, our reliance on these systems exposes us to risks of disruption or damage from cybersecurity risks, such as malware, virus, hacking, denial of service, ransomware, physical or electronic break-ins, insider threats, and phishing attacks, all of which are increasingly sophisticated and prevalent. Our systems may be misconfigured or configured in a way that exacerbates our exposure to these risks. Despite having no significant breaches detected so far, we regularly are targeted by threat actors, and completely preventing or detecting such incidents promptly is increasingly challenging.\nThe complex nature of cybersecurity threats means a breach could go undetected for a long time, if ever, and responding to such incidents may not always be immediate or sufficient. Moreover, we depend on third-party vendors to implement security programs commensurate with their own risk. They may not be successful at defending against or detecting cybersecurity threats and they may not be obligated to inform us of such incidents. The consequences of a cyber-attack may include operational disruption, unauthorized access to sensitive data, regulatory fines, reputational damage, liability to third parties, and financial losses. \nThe impact of cybersecurity incidents is difficult to predict, and the evolving legal and regulatory environment around data privacy and security could lead to increased costs and stricter compliance requirements. During an investigation of a cybersecurity incident, or a series of events, it is possible we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how to remediate it, which could further adversely impact us, and new regulations may also compel us to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident before it has been mitigated or resolved, or even fully investigated. Furthermore, whether a single or series of cyber events is material is often a matter of judgment rather than quantitative measures and might only be determinable well after the fact. Despite our efforts to enhance our cybersecurity defenses, we cannot assure complete \n15\nprotection against all cybersecurity threats.  A cybersecurity incident, if one were to occur, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.  \nRisks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT\nOur failure to qualify as a REIT would have adverse tax consequences.\nWe believe that we operate in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. We plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. The determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within our control, and our compliance with the annual REIT income and quarterly asset requirements depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 75% of our gross income must come from real estate sources and 95% of our gross income must come from real estate sources and certain other sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. Additionally, our ability to satisfy the REIT asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Furthermore, the proper classification of an instrument as debt or equity for federal income tax purposes may be uncertain in some circumstances, which could affect the application of the REIT asset requirements. We are also required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and by excluding any net capital gain).\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT in any tax year, we would be subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years following the year we first fail to qualify. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we may have to pay significant income taxes and would, therefore, have less money available for investments or for distributions to our stockholders. This would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our equity. In addition, the tax law would no longer require us to make distributions to our stockholders.\nIf we fail to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification, we may still qualify as a REIT if there is reasonable cause for the failure, it is not due to willful neglect, and we satisfy other requirements, including completion of applicable IRS filings. It is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. If these relief provisions were inapplicable, we would not qualify as a REIT. Furthermore, even if we satisfy the relief provisions and maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may be still subject to a penalty tax. The penalty tax for failure to satisfy an asset test would be the greater of $50,000 per failure or an amount equal to the net income generated by the assets that resulted in the failure multiplied by the highest U.S. federal corporate tax rate in effect at the time of the failure. The penalty tax for failure to satisfy one or both gross income tests would be an amount equal to 100% of the net profit on the gross income that resulted in the failure calculated in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code. \nREIT distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, for U.S. federal and state corporate income tax not to apply to earnings that we distribute and to retain our REIT status. Distributions of our taxable income must generally occur in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration. We may also elect to retain, rather than distribute, our net long-term capital gains and pay tax on such gains if required, in which case, we could elect for our stockholders to include their proportionate share of such undistributed long-term capital gains in income, and to receive a corresponding credit for their share of the tax that we paid. Our stockholders would then increase the adjusted basis of their stock by the difference between (a) the amounts of capital gain dividends that we designated and that they include in their taxable income, minus (b) the tax that we paid on their behalf with respect to that income. We intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the REIT qualification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, which limits our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital from operations.\nTo the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement, but distribute less than 100% of our taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. Furthermore, if we should fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (a) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for such year, (b) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year, and (c) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be subject to a non-deductible 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the sum of (x) the amounts actually distributed, (y) the amounts of income we retained and on which we have paid corporate income tax and (z) any excess distributions from prior periods.\n16\nOur taxable income will typically differ from income prepared in accordance with GAAP due to temporary and permanent differences. For example, realized gains and losses on our hedging instruments, such as interest rate swaps, may be deferred for income tax purposes and amortized into taxable income over the remaining contract term of the instrument even if we have exited the instrument and settled such gains or losses for cash. We are also not allowed to reduce our taxable income for net capital losses incurred; instead, the capital losses may be carried forward for a period of up to five years and applied against future capital gains subject to our ability to generate sufficient capital gains, which cannot be assured. Therefore, it is possible that our taxable income could be in excess of the net cash generated from our operations. If we do not have funds available in these situations to meet our REIT distribution requirements or to avoid corporate and excise taxes altogether, we could be required to borrow funds on unfavorable terms, sell investments at disadvantageous prices or distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions. \nWe may choose to pay dividends in our own stock, in which case stockholders may be required to pay income taxes in excess of cash dividends received.\nWe may in the future distribute taxable dividends that are payable at least in part in shares of our common stock. Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends that are in excess of the cash dividends received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as a dividend to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock.\nEven if we remain qualified as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow.\nEven if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may nonetheless be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including the following items. Any of these or other taxes we may incur would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\n\u2022\nRegular U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes on any undistributed taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains. \n\u2022\nA non-deductible 4% excise tax if the actual amount distributed to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under Federal tax laws. \n\u2022\nCorporate income taxes on the earnings of subsidiaries, to the extent that such subsidiaries are subchapter C corporations and are not qualified REIT subsidiaries or other disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes.\n\u2022\nA 100% tax on certain transactions between us and our TRSs that do not reflect arm's-length terms. \n\u2022\nIf we acquire appreciated assets from a corporation that is not a REIT (i.e., a corporation taxable under subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code) in a transaction in which the adjusted tax basis of the assets in our hands is determined by reference to the adjusted tax basis of the assets in the hands of the subchapter C corporation, we may be subject to tax on such appreciation at the highest corporate income tax rate then applicable if we subsequently recognize a gain on a disposition of any such assets during the five-year period following their acquisition from the subchapter C corporation. \n\u2022\nA 100% tax on net income and gains from \"prohibited transactions.\"\n\u2022\nPenalty taxes and other fines for failure to satisfy one or more requirements for REIT qualification.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause us to liquidate or forgo attractive investment opportunities.\nTo remain qualified as a REIT, we must ensure that, at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified real estate assets. The remainder of our investments in securities (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) generally cannot include more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10% of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer. In addition, in general, no more than 5% of the value of our assets (other than government securities and qualified real estate assets) can consist of the securities of any one issuer, and no more than 20% of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. If we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter, we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. We must also satisfy tests concerning the sources of our income and the amounts that we distribute to our stockholders. Complying with these requirements may prevent us from acquiring certain attractive investments or we may be required to sell otherwise attractive investments. Thus, the potential returns on our investment portfolio may be lower than if we were not subject to such requirements. Additionally, if we \n17\nmust liquidate our investments to repay our lenders or to satisfy other obligations, we may be unable to comply with these requirements, potentially jeopardizing our qualification as a REIT.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code could substantially limit our ability to hedge our risks. Any income from a properly designated hedging transaction to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made, or ordinary obligations incurred or to be incurred, to acquire or carry real estate assets generally does not constitute \"gross income\" for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests (\"qualified hedges\"). To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, or fail to properly designate qualified hedges, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as non-qualifying income for purposes of both gross income tests. As such, we may have to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a TRS. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities as our TRS would be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, losses in a TRS will generally not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward against future taxable income in the TRS.\nUncertainty exists with respect to the treatment of our TBAs for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests.\nThere is no direct authority with respect to the qualification of TBAs as real estate assets or U.S. Government securities for purposes of the 75% asset test or the qualification of income or gains from dispositions of TBAs as gains from the sale of real property or other qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. However, we treat our TBAs as qualifying assets for purposes of the REIT 75% asset test, and we treat income and gains from our TBAs as qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, based on a legal opinion of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP (\u201cSkadden\u201d) substantially to the effect that (i) for purposes of the REIT asset tests, our ownership of a TBA should be treated as ownership of the underlying Agency RMBS, and (ii) for purposes of the 75% REIT gross income test, any gain recognized by us in connection with the settlement of our TBAs should be treated as gain from the sale or disposition of the underlying Agency RMBS. Opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS, and no assurance can be given that the IRS will not successfully challenge the conclusions set forth in such opinions. In addition, it must be emphasized that Skadden\u2019s opinion is based on various assumptions relating to our TBAs and is conditioned upon fact-based representations and covenants made by our management regarding our TBAs. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert that such assets or income are not qualifying assets or income. If the IRS were to successfully challenge Skadden\u2019s opinion, we could be subject to a penalty tax or we could fail to remain qualified as a REIT if a sufficient portion of our assets consists of TBAs or a sufficient portion of our income consists of income or gains from the disposition of TBAs.\nQualifying as a REIT involves highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Internal Revenue Code provisions on a continuous basis for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Our application of such provisions may be dependent on interpretations of the provisions by the staff of the Internal Revenue Service, which may change over time. Even a technical or inadvertent violation of the Internal Revenue Code provisions could jeopardize our REIT qualification. \nThe tax on prohibited transactions could limit our ability to engage in certain transactions.\nNet income that we derive from a \"prohibited transaction\" is subject to a 100% tax. The term \"prohibited transaction\" generally includes a sale or other disposition of property that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business by us or by a borrower that has issued a shared appreciation mortgage or similar debt instrument to us. We could be subject to this tax if we were to dispose of assets or structure transactions in a manner that is treated as a prohibited transaction for federal income tax purposes. \nWe intend to structure our activities to avoid classification as prohibited transactions. As a result, we may choose not to engage in certain transactions at the REIT level that might otherwise be beneficial to us. In addition, whether property is held \"primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business\" depends on the particular facts and circumstances. Thus, no assurance can be given that any property that we sell will not be treated as such or that we can comply with certain safe-harbor provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that would prevent such treatment. The 100% tax does not apply to gains from the sale of property that is held through a TRS or other taxable corporation, although such income will be subject to tax at the entity\u2019s regular corporate rates.\nDistributions to tax-exempt investors may be classified as unrelated business taxable income.\nAlthough distributions with respect to our common stock generally do not constitute unrelated business taxable income, there are some circumstances where they may. If (i) we generate \"excess inclusion income\" as a result of all or a portion of our \n18\nassets being subject to rules relating to \"taxable mortgage pools\" or as a result of holding residual interests in a REMIC or (ii) we become a \"pension held REIT,\" then a portion of the distributions to tax exempt investors may be subject to U.S. federal income tax as unrelated business taxable income under the Internal Revenue Code.\nLegislative and Regulatory Risks\nLoss of our exemption from regulation pursuant to the Investment Company Act would adversely affect us.\nWe conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, requires that: (i) at least 55% of our investment portfolio consists of \"mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate,\" or \"qualifying real estate interests,\" and (ii) at least 80% of our investment portfolio consists of qualifying real estate interests plus \"real estate-related assets.\"\nThe specific real estate related assets that we acquire are limited by the provisions of the Investment Company Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In satisfying the 55% requirement, we treat Agency RMBS issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgage loans in which we directly or indirectly hold all the certificates issued by the pool (\"whole pool\" securities) as qualifying real estate interests based on pronouncements of the SEC staff. We treat partial pool securities, CRT and other mortgage related securities as real estate-related assets. Consequently, our ability to satisfy the exemption under the Investment Company Act is dependent upon our ability to acquire and hold on a continuous basis a sufficient amount of whole pool securities. The availability of whole pool securities may be adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including GSE pooling practices, which can change over time, housing finance reform initiatives and competition for whole pool securities with other mortgage REITs.\nAdditionally, if the SEC determines that any of our securities are not qualifying interests in real estate or real estate-related assets, otherwise believes we do not satisfy the above exceptions or changes its interpretation with respect to these securities or the above exceptions, we could be required to restructure our activities or sell certain of our assets. As such, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to acquire or hold enough whole pool securities to maintain our exemption under the Investment Company Act, and our compliance with these requirements may at times lead us to adopt less efficient methods of investing in certain securities or to forego acquiring more desirable securities. Importantly, if we fail to qualify for this exemption, our ability to use leverage would be substantially reduced and we would be unable to conduct our business as we currently conduct it, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nFailure to satisfy regulatory requirements of our captive broker-dealer subsidiary could result in our inability to access tri-party repo funding through the FICC\u2019s GCF Repo service and could be harmful to our business operations.\nBES is subject to ongoing membership and regulatory requirements as a member of the FICC and FINRA and as an SEC registered broker-dealer that include but are not limited to trade practices, use and safekeeping of funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping and conduct of directors, officers and employees. Additionally, as a self-clearing, registered broker-dealer, BES is subject to minimum net capital requirements. Our ability to access tri-party repo funding through the FICC's GCF Repo service, which represents a significant portion of our total borrowing capacity, and our ability to conduct self-clearing of our investment and funding activity through BES are reliant on BES' ability to continually meet these regulatory and membership requirements. If BES were to lose its memberships in FICC and FINRA or its status as a self-clearing registered broker-dealer, we may be unable to find alternative sources of financing on favorable terms and we may experience business interruptions as we attempt to transfer custody and clearing activities to alternative providers that would be harmful to our business. \nNew legislation or administrative or judicial action could make it more difficult or impossible for us to remain qualified as a REIT or it could otherwise adversely affect REITs and their stockholders.\nThe present U.S. federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect our ability to maintain our REIT status and/or the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. The federal income tax rules dealing with REITs constantly are under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations. Revisions in Federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could affect or cause us to change our investments and affect the tax considerations of an investment in us.\n19\nActions of the U.S. Government, including the U.S. Congress, Fed, U.S. Treasury, Federal Housing Finance Administration (\"FHFA\") and other governmental and regulatory bodies may adversely affect our business.\nU.S. Government legislative and administrative actions may have an adverse impact on the financial markets. To the extent the markets do not respond favorably to any such actions or such actions do not function as intended, they could have broad adverse market implications and could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the actual or anticipated actions or inaction on U.S. fiscal policy matters, including the U.S. dept ceiling and the amount and tenor of U.S. Treasury debt required to fund the government, could result in a wide range of negative economic effects, including increased financial market and interest rate volatility and wider market spreads between mortgage assets and benchmark interest rates.\nAdditionally, new regulatory requirements, including the imposition of more stringent bank capital rules and changes to the manner and timing of clearing U.S. Treasury and Agency RMBS transactions, could adversely affect the availability or terms of financing from our lending counterparties, reduce market liquidity, restrict the origination of residential mortgage loans and the formation of new issuances of mortgage-backed securities and limit the trading activities of certain banking entities and other systemically significant organizations that are important to our business. For example, the Fed and Federal Deposit Insurance Commission have proposed amendments to the capital rules for banks subject to their supervision that would apply risk weights (and costs) to Agency RMBS that may, if adopted as proposed, impact the source, pricing, volume, financing, and nature of Agency RMBS, and the SEC Division of Trading and Markets has adopted regulations requiring the central clearing of U.S. Treasury and U.S. Treasury repo transactions that will require significant changes to trading operations and has the potential to adversely impact liquidity, funding and efficiency of these markets, which could adversely impact the cost and other terms or availability of financing and hedging arrangements for our business. Together or individually new regulatory requirements could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations in adverse ways.\nFederal housing finance reform and potential changes to the Federal conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or to laws or regulations affecting the relationship between the GSEs and the U.S. Government may adversely affect our business. \nThe payments of principal and interest we receive on our Agency RMBS are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. The guarantees on Agency securities created by Ginnie Mae are explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, whereas the guarantees on Agency securities created by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not.\nIn September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into the conservatorship of the FHFA, their federal regulator. In addition to the conservatorships, the U.S. Department of the Treasury has provided a liquidity backstop to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to ensure their financial stability. Over time, efforts to end the conservatorships and the guarantee-payment structure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have garnered attention from the U.S. Government. During the final year of the Trump Administration, FHFA established new regulatory capital requirements necessary for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to exit conservatorship, and the U.S. Treasury Department amended the terms of its liquidity backstop to enable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to retain a greater amount of capital in order to achieve these levels, subject to certain conditions. Since taking office, the Biden Administration and the FHFA have delayed implementation or reversed some of these initiatives and have taken steps intended to advance other housing finance policy objectives. Although the FHFA has adopted amendments to GSE regulatory capital requirements, it has also taken steps to implement them, including by permitting the GSEs to charge fees that seek to offset related capital charges on certain Agency RMBS. These or future administrative actions may significantly impact the source, pricing, volume and nature of Agency RMBS and other mortgage securities that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issue. \nFurther administrative and/or legislative actions may be taken that affect structural GSE and federal housing finance reform, alter the amount or nature of the credit support provided by the U.S. Treasury to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, modify the future roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in housing finance or otherwise impact the value or relative fungibility of Agency RMBS issued by each GSE. Such actions may create market uncertainty, may have the effect of reducing the actual or perceived credit quality of securities issued or guaranteed by them or may otherwise impact the size and scope of the Agency RMBS markets. To the extent such actions would terminate the conservatorships without also providing for a sufficiently robust U.S. government guaranty, they could re-define what constitutes an Agency security and subject Agency RMBS to greater credit risk, make them more difficult to finance, and cause their values to decline, all of which could have broad adverse implications for the mortgage markets and our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations. If the market price of our common stock declines significantly, stockholders may be unable to resell shares at a gain. Furthermore, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock may adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and our ability to \n20\nraise additional equity capital. Price fluctuations may result in our stock trading below our reported net tangible book value per share for extended periods of time. Variations in the price of our common stock can be affected by any one of the risk factors described herein. Variations may also occur due to a variety of factors unrelated to our financial performance, such as:\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions, including actual and anticipated changes in interest rates and mortgage spreads;\n\u2022\nchanges in government policy, rules and regulations applicable to mortgage REITs, including tax laws, financial accounting and reporting standards, and exemptions from the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results as well as relative to levels expected by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nissuance of shares of common stock or securities convertible into common stock, which may be issued at a price below tangible net book value per share of common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future or issuance of preferred stock senior in priority to our common stock;\n\u2022\nactions by stockholders, individually or collectively;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our dividend policy; and\n\u2022\nchanges to our targeted investments or investment guidelines.\nWe have not established a minimum dividend payment level and may be unable to pay dividends in the future.\nWe intend to pay monthly dividends to our common stockholders in an amount that all or substantially all our taxable income is distributed within the limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. However, we have not established a minimum dividend payment level and the amount of our dividend may fluctuate. Our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected by the risk factors described herein. All distributions will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on our earnings and financial condition, the requirements for REIT qualification and such other factors as our Board of Directors deems relevant from time to time. Additionally, our preferred stock has a preference on dividend payments and liquidating distributions that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Therefore, we may not be able to make distributions in the future or our Board of Directors may change our dividend policy. \nOur certificate of incorporation generally does not permit ownership of more than 9.8% of our common or capital stock and attempts to acquire amounts above this limit will be ineffective unless an exemption is granted by our Board of Directors.\nFor the purpose of complying with REIT ownership limitations under the Internal Revenue Code, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation generally prohibits beneficial or constructive ownership by any person of more than 9.8% of our common or capital stock (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive), unless exempted by our Board of Directors. Such constructive ownership rules are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of 9.8% or less of the outstanding stock by an individual, entity or group could result in constructive ownership greater than 9.8% and thus be subject to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation's ownership limit. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common or preferred stock more than the ownership limit without the consent of the Board of Directors will result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or, if the transfer to a charitable trust would not be effective, such transfer being treated as invalid from the outset. Such ownership limit could also delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders.",

Our cybersecurity program aligns with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and we conduct reviews of its effectiveness on a regular basis through annual testing, periodic third-party evaluations of our processes and controls, and ongoing surveillance.  This program involves the use of cybersecurity tools to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover from cybersecurity threats.  Additionally, we engage with third-party cybersecurity consultants and other professional advisors to gain insight and knowledge into emerging threats, industry trends and emerging practices. Annually, we review cybersecurity risk in the context of our overall enterprise risk management assessment. As a component of these processes, our management \n21\nteam, including our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, identifies and assesses the likelihood and magnitude of risks, on both inherent and residual basis.  These evaluations inform our overall cybersecurity strategy.\nOur business operations depend significantly on third party service providers. We have processes in place to evaluate the operational and cybersecurity risks posed to us by third parties on whom we are reliant for these services at the inception of our engagement, and we annually review third-party firms that pose the greatest risks to our business and operations from cybersecurity threats. Nonetheless, we rely on the third parties we use to implement security programs commensurate with their own risk, and we cannot ensure that their efforts will be successful.\nOur primary business involves investments in mortgages and mortgage instruments, but we do not perform mortgage servicing, maintain customer accounts, or provide any direct mortgage lending. Nor do we receive personal information on individual mortgage borrowers as part of our regular operations.  However, our business is highly dependent on the availability of information systems, and a cybersecurity incident, if one were to occur, could have the potential to disrupt our operations.  Please refer to \nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\n in Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of the risks posed by cybersecurity threats. \nGovernance and Oversight\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility to oversee management\u2019s strategy to address risks from cybersecurity threats. The Audit Committee periodically reviews with management the Company\u2019s policies, controls, and procedures used to identify, mitigate, and manage cybersecurity risks. To accomplish this objective, we have established processes for reporting cybersecurity risks to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis. This report, which is prepared by our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, includes performance as against key performance indicators (KPIs) and service level objectives specifically defined to measure the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls and risk management efforts, current threat landscape, and strategy. In addition, on an annual basis the Company\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer presents to the Audit Committee on cybersecurity matters, including material changes to the Company\u2019s information systems, policies and controls, the results of penetration and other testing and findings from any third-party reviews.  Our Audit Committee is committed to maintaining a well-informed and cybersecurity-aware posture, regularly engaging by receiving scheduled and requested updates on our strategy to address risks from cybersecurity threats and the evolving threat landscape. The Board of Directors also is appraised of cybersecurity risks as part of its review of management\u2019s annual enterprise risk management assessment.  \nManagement plays a pivotal role in identifying, assessing, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats. This involves continuous monitoring, analyzing emerging threats, and the development and implementation of risk mitigation strategies. Led by our Senior Vice President and Chief Technology Officer with over 20 years of cyber and risk management experience, the Company actively implements and enforces cybersecurity policies, procedures, and strategies, including employee training programs, security assessments, and updates to ensure alignment with our evolving threat landscape.

Our MD&A is presented in the following sections:\n\u2022\nExecutive Overview\n\u2022\nFinancial Condition\n\u2022\nSummary of Critical Accounting Estimates\n\u2022\nResults of Operations\n\u2022\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\u2022\nForward-Looking Statements\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nWe are a leading provider of private capital to the U.S. housing market, enhancing liquidity in the residential real estate mortgage markets and, in turn, facilitating home ownership in the U.S. We invest primarily in Agency RMBS on a leveraged basis. These investments consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or by a U.S. Government agency, such as Ginnie Mae. We may also invest in other assets related to the housing, mortgage or real estate markets that are not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency.\nWe are internally managed with the principal objective of generating favorable long-term stockholder returns with a substantial yield component. We generate income from the interest earned on our investments, net of associated borrowing and hedging costs, and net realized gains and losses on our investment and hedging activities. We fund our investments primarily through collateralized borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. We operate in a manner to qualify to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. \nWe employ an active management strategy that is dynamic and responsive to evolving market conditions. The composition of our portfolio and our investment, funding, and hedging strategies are tailored to reflect our analysis of market conditions and the relative values of available options. Market conditions are influenced by a variety of factors, including interest rates, prepayment expectations, liquidity, housing prices, unemployment rates, general economic conditions, government participation in the mortgage market, regulations and relative returns on other assets. \nTrends and Recent Market Impacts\nThe Federal Reserve continued its unprecedented dual-track approach to monetary policy tightening in 2023. Since the beginning of this cycle in 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised the Federal Funds rate by 525 basis points and reduced its balance sheet by $1.3 trillion. This aggressive Federal Reserve campaign and a number of other macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including persistent inflation, regional bank failures and fears of broader financial contagion, political uncertainty regarding the U.S. debt ceiling and gross supply of U.S. Treasury securities, and significant global geopolitical events, led to sharply higher interest rate and Agency RMBS spread volatility throughout the year. While a number of the risks related to these factors remain and will continue to influence Agency RMBS performance going forward, market uncertainty about many of them has declined considerably from peak levels experienced during the year. \nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury increased 170 basis points from the April 2023 low of 3.3% to nearly 5.0% in mid-October before declining 110 basis points to 3.9% at year end, ending the year unchanged. The current coupon Agency RMBS spread to a blend of 5- and 10-year Treasuries began the year at 145 basis points and reached 190 basis points in May and again in October, approximating levels that Agency RMBS spreads had previously reached since 2000 only during extreme financial market dislocations - the Great Financial Crisis and the peak of the Covid pandemic - before declining to 139 basis points at year end. \nChallenging fixed income environments underscore the importance of active portfolio management and prioritization of risk management.  To that end, AGNC maintained a large interest rate hedge position, averaging over 115% of our repo funding and TBA position for 2023 and 2022, and a reduced leverage profile, averaging 7.4x and 7.8x of our tangible stockholders' equity for 2023 and 2022, respectively.  In addition, our liquidity as a percentage of our stockholders' equity remained within normal operating levels despite the difficult environment, with unencumbered cash and Agency RMBS growing to $5.1 billion, or 66% of our tangible stockholders' equity, as of the end of 2023, up from $4.3 billion, or 59% of tangible stockholders\u2019 \n25\nequity, the previous year-end. To capitalize on higher asset yields and wider spreads, in 2023, we continued to shift our asset portfolio away from TBA and lower coupon holdings toward a greater share of higher coupon, high-quality specified pools.  As a result, the weighted average coupon on our fixed-rate Agency RMBS and TBA securities increased to 4.83% as of December 31, 2023 from 4.13% as of the previous year-end. Additionally, we opportunistically issued $1.1 billion and $0.5 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively, of accretive common equity through our At-the-Market offering program to capitalize on our material price to book premium.\nAGNC earned total comprehensive income of $0.30 per diluted common share for fiscal year 2023, versus a loss of $4.22 in fiscal year 2022. Our total economic return on tangible common equity was 3.0% for 2023, comprised of $1.44 dividends declared per common share and a $1.14 decline in tangible net book value per common share, compared to a loss of 28.4% for 2022. Net spread and dollar roll income (a non-GAAP measure) per diluted common share totaled $2.61 for fiscal year 2023, compared to $3.11 for 2022, as higher asset yields and our pay-fixed / receive-variable interest rate swap portfolio largely offset rising repo funding costs and declining TBA dollar roll income during the year. \nAs a levered investor in Agency RMBS, AGNC's performance is primarily driven by changes in Agency RMBS spreads to benchmark interest rates and interest rate volatility. Looking ahead, although risk measures for volatility remain elevated by historical standards, we believe a more favorable investment environment for Agency RMBS is emerging, supported by three key developments. First, the Fed adopted a more neutral monetary policy stance in the fourth quarter and indicated that multiple rate cuts are possible in 2024 if inflation continues to improve as expected. Second, many of the factors that drove the high levels of interest rate volatility in 2023 have now largely subsided, which should, in turn, enhance the attractiveness of Agency RMBS and reduce the cost of our interest rate risk management activities. Third, Agency RMBS spreads appear to have settled into a new trading range, providing us additional confidence in our view that the secular spread widening associated with the Federal Reserve\u2019s reduced presence in the Agency RMBS market has reached its conclusion. Importantly, the higher end of this recent trading range has held on several repeated occasions, as the nearly 2.0% yield benefit for Agency RMBS relative to Treasury securities at these wide spread levels led to strong incremental demand for Agency RMBS. These developments collectively position Agency RMBS as an attractive investment option, both on an absolute and relative basis, in our view, and form the basis for our positive investment outlook.  \nFor information regarding non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure please refer to Results of Operations included in this MD&A below. For information regarding the sensitivity of our tangible net book value per common share to changes in interest rates and mortgage spreads, please refer to Item 7A. \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n in this form \n10-K\n.\n26\nMarket Information\nThe following table summarizes benchmark interest rates and prices of generic fixed rate Agency RMBS as of each date presented below: \nInterest Rate/Security Price \n1\nDec. 31, 2022\nMar. 31, 2023\nJune 30, 2023\nSept. 30, 2023\nDec. 31, 2023\nDec. 31, 2023\nvs\nDec. 31, 2022\nTarget Federal Funds Rate: \nTarget Federal Funds Rate - Upper Band\n4.50%\n5.00%\n5.25%\n5.50%\n5.50%\n+100\u00a0\nbps\nSOFR:\nSOFR Rate\n4.30%\n4.87%\n5.09%\n5.31%\n5.38%\n+108\u00a0\nbps\nSOFR Interest Rate Swap Rate:\n2-Year Swap\n4.45%\n4.06%\n4.82%\n4.97%\n4.07%\n-38\u00a0\nbps\n5-Year Swap\n3.75%\n3.34%\n3.94%\n4.38%\n3.53%\n-22\u00a0\nbps\n10-Year Swap\n3.56%\n3.17%\n3.58%\n4.27%\n3.47%\n-9\u00a0\nbps\n30-Year Swap\n3.21%\n2.93%\n3.20%\n4.01%\n3.32%\n+11\u00a0\nbps\nU.S. Treasury Security Rate:\n2-Year U.S. Treasury\n4.43%\n4.03%\n4.90%\n5.05%\n4.25%\n-18\u00a0\nbps\n5-Year U.S. Treasury\n4.01%\n3.58%\n4.16%\n4.61%\n3.85%\n-16\u00a0\nbps\n10-Year U.S. Treasury\n3.88%\n3.47%\n3.84%\n4.57%\n3.88%\n\u2014\u00a0\nbps\n30-Year U.S. Treasury\n3.97%\n3.65%\n3.86%\n4.70%\n4.03%\n+6\u00a0\nbps\n30-Year Fixed Rate Agency Price:\n2.5%\n$84.96\n$86.16\n$84.77\n$79.39\n$85.24\n+$0.28\n3.0%\n$88.02\n$89.63\n$88.01\n$82.75\n$88.58\n+$0.56\n3.5%\n$91.10\n$92.82\n$91.11\n$86.02\n$91.86\n+$0.76\n4.0%\n$94.03\n$95.59\n$93.84\n$89.09\n$94.69\n+$0.66\n4.5%\n$96.59\n$97.92\n$96.14\n$91.85\n$97.04\n+$0.45\n5.0%\n$98.80\n$99.69\n$98.00\n$94.39\n$99.04\n+$0.24\n5.5%\n$100.47\n$101.00\n$99.55\n$96.68\n$100.56\n+$0.09\n6.0%\n$101.69\n$102.08\n$100.88\n$98.74\n$101.63\n-$0.06\n6.5%\n$102.57\n$103.23\n$102.12\n$100.52\n$102.51\n-$0.06\n15-Year Fixed Rate Agency Price:\n1.5%\n$86.84\n$87.95\n$86.30\n$83.27\n$86.86\n+$0.02\n2.0%\n$89.28\n$90.36\n$88.61\n$85.81\n$89.47\n+$0.19\n2.5%\n$91.80\n$92.83\n$90.98\n$88.21\n$92.14\n+$0.34\n3.0%\n$93.85\n$94.83\n$93.32\n$90.54\n$94.30\n+$0.45\n3.5%\n$95.93\n$96.68\n$95.14\n$92.52\n$96.39\n+$0.46\n4.0%\n$97.75\n$98.41\n$96.59\n$94.42\n$98.10\n+$0.35\n________________________________\n1.\nPrice information is for generic instruments only and is not reflective of our specific portfolio holdings.

We rely on our experience and analysis of historical and current market data to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions, we could report materially different amounts based on such estimates. For additional information regarding our significant accounting policies please refer to Note 2 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nInterest Income\nThe effective yield on our Agency RMBS and non-Agency securities of high credit quality is highly impacted by our estimate of future prepayments. We accrue interest income based on the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of these securities, and we amortize or accrete premiums and discounts associated with our purchase of these securities into interest income over their projected lives, incorporating scheduled contractual payments and estimated prepayments, using the effective interest method. The weighted average cost basis of our securities as of December 31, 2023 was 102.2% of par value; therefore, changes in our actual or projected prepayments can significantly alter the effective yield on our assets.\n31\nFuture prepayment rates are difficult to predict, and we rely on a third-party service provider and our experience and analysis of historical and current market data to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Our third-party service provider estimates prepayment rates over the remaining life of our securities using models that incorporate the forward yield curve, current mortgage rates, mortgage rates on the outstanding loans, age and size of the outstanding loans, loan-to-value ratios, interest rate volatility and other factors. We review the estimated prepayment rates for reasonableness, giving consideration to historical prepayment rates, current market conditions and other factors we believe are likely to impact the rate of prepayments on our portfolio, and based on our judgment we may adjust the third-party estimates. \nWe review our actual and anticipated prepayment experience on at least a quarterly basis, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between (i) our previous prepayment estimates and (ii) actual prepayments to date and current estimates of future prepayments. If the actual and estimated future prepayment experience differs from our prior estimate of prepayments, we are required to record an adjustment in the current period to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts for the cumulative difference in the effective yield from inception through the reporting date. We commonly refer to this adjustment as \"catch-up\" premium amortization cost/benefit. \nThe most significant factor impacting prepayment rates on our securities is changes to long-term interest rates. Prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise. Item 7A.\n Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk \nin this Form 10-K includes the estimated weighted average projected CPR of our investments and the corresponding weighted average yield on our investments should interest rates instantaneously go up or down by 25, 50, and 75 basis points. However, there are a variety of other factors that may impact the rate of prepayments on our securities. Consequently, our actual experience and future estimates of prepayments could differ materially from our estimates.\nAt the time we purchase CRT and non-Agency securities that are not of high credit quality, we determine an effective interest rate based on our estimate of the timing and amount of cash flows and our cost basis. On at least a quarterly basis, we review the estimated cash flows and make appropriate adjustments based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, including collateral call provisions, timing and amount of estimated credit losses, and other factors. Any resulting changes in effective yield are recognized prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment as adjusted for credit impairment, if any. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, our results of operations discussed below include certain non-GAAP financial information, including \"economic interest income,\" \"economic interest expense,\" and \"net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders\"\n1\n and the related per common share measures and certain financial metrics derived from such non-GAAP information.\n\"Economic interest income\" is measured as interest income (GAAP measure), adjusted to (i) exclude retrospective \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost associated with changes in projected CPR estimates and (ii) include TBA dollar roll implied interest income. \"Economic interest expense\" is measured as interest expense (GAAP measure) adjusted to include TBA dollar roll implied interest expense/benefit and interest rate swap periodic cost/income. \"Net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders\" is measured as comprehensive income (loss) available (attributable) to common stockholders (GAAP measure) adjusted to: (i) exclude gains/losses on investment securities recognized through net income and other comprehensive income and gains/losses on derivative instruments and other securities (GAAP measures); (ii) exclude retrospective \"catch-up\" adjustments to premium amortization cost associated with changes in projected CPR estimates; and (iii) include interest rate swap periodic income/cost, TBA dollar roll income and other interest income/expense. As defined \"Net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders\" includes (i) the components of \"economic interest income\" and \"economic interest expense\", plus (ii) other interest income/expense, and less (iii) total operating expenses and dividends on preferred stock (GAAP measures). \nBy providing such measures, in addition to the related GAAP measures, we believe we give greater transparency into the information used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making. We also believe it is important for users of our financial information to consider information related to our current financial performance without the effects of certain measures and one-time events that are not necessarily indicative of our current investment portfolio performance and operations. \nSpecifically, in the case \"net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders\" and components of such measure, \"economic interest income\" and \"economic interest expense,\" we believe the inclusion of TBA dollar roll income is meaningful as TBAs, which are accounted for under GAAP as derivative instruments with gains and losses recognized in other \n32\ngain (loss) in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income, are economically equivalent to holding and financing generic Agency RMBS using short-term repurchase agreements. Similarly, we believe that the inclusion of periodic interest rate swap settlements is meaningful as interest rate swaps are the primary instrument we use to economically hedge against fluctuations in our borrowing costs and it is more indicative of our total cost of funds than interest expense alone. Additionally, we believe the exclusion of \"catch-up\" premium amortization adjustments is meaningful as it excludes the cumulative effect from prior reporting periods due to current changes in future prepayment expectations and, therefore, exclusion of such adjustments is more indicative of the current earnings potential of our investment portfolio.\nHowever, because such measures are incomplete measures of our financial performance and involve differences from results computed in accordance with GAAP, they should be considered as supplementary to, and not as a substitute for, results computed in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of such non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\n________________________________\n1.\n\"Net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders\" was previously referred to as \"net spread and dollar roll income, excluding 'catch-up' premium amortization, available to common stockholders\". \"Net spread and dollar roll income available to common stockholders\" continues to exclude \"catch-up\" premium amortization. \nSelected Financial Data\nThe following selected financial data is derived from our annual financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2023.

The average yield on our investment portfolio, including TBA implied asset yields and excluding \"catch-up\" premium amortization, increased 111 and 88 basis points for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, largely as a result of shifting our asset portfolio away from TBA and lower coupon holdings toward a greater share of higher coupon, high-quality specified pools to capitalize on higher asset yields and wider spreads.\nLeverage\nOur primary measure of leverage is our tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage ratio, which is measured as the sum of our repurchase agreements and other debt used to fund our investment securities and net TBA and forward settling securities position (at cost) (together referred to as \"mortgage borrowings\") and our net receivable/payable for unsettled investment securities, divided by our total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill.\nWe include our net TBA position in our measure of leverage because a forward contract to acquire Agency RMBS in the TBA market carries similar risks to Agency RMBS purchased in the cash market and funded with on-balance sheet liabilities. Similarly, a TBA contract for the forward sale of Agency securities has substantially the same effect as selling the underlying Agency RMBS and reducing our on-balance sheet funding commitments. (Refer to \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nin this Form 10-K for further discussion of TBA securities and dollar roll transactions). Repurchase agreements used to fund short-term investments in U.S. Treasury securities (\"U.S. Treasury repo\") are excluded from our measure of leverage due to the temporary and highly liquid nature of these investments.

Our primary sources of liquidity are unencumbered cash and securities, borrowings available under repurchase agreements, TBA dollar roll financing and monthly receipts of principal and interest payments. We may also conduct asset sales, change our asset or funding mix, issue equity or undertake other capital enhancing actions to maintain adequate levels of liquidity and capital resources. There are various risks and uncertainties that can impact our liquidity, such as those described in Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n and Item 7A. \nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures of Market Risks\n in this Form 10-K. In assessing our liquidity, we consider a number of factors, including our current leverage, collateral levels, access to capital markets, overall market conditions, and the sensitivity of our tangible net book value over a range of scenarios. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available to meet our obligations and execute our business strategy.\nLeverage and Financing Sources\nOur leverage will vary depending on market conditions and our assessment of relative risks and returns, but we generally expect our leverage to be between six and twelve times the amount of our tangible stockholders' equity, measured as the sum of our total mortgage borrowings and net payable / (receivable) for unsettled investment securities, divided by the sum of our total stockholders' equity adjusted to exclude goodwill. Our tangible net book value \"at risk\" leverage ratio was 7.0x and 7.4x as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The following table includes a summary of our mortgage borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (dollars in millions). For additional details of our mortgage borrowings refer to Notes 2, 4 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nMortgage Borrowings\nAmount\n%\nAmount\n%\nInvestment securities repurchase agreements \n1,2\n$\n48,879\u00a0\n90\u00a0\n%\n$\n35,907\u00a0\n66\u00a0\n%\nDebt of consolidated variable interest entities, at fair value\n80\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n95\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\nTotal debt\n48,959\u00a0\n90\u00a0\n%\n36,002\u00a0\n66\u00a0\n%\nTBA and forward settling non-Agency securities, at cost\n5,288\u00a0\n10\u00a0\n%\n18,407\u00a0\n34\u00a0\n%\nTotal mortgage borrowings\n$\n54,247\u00a0\n100\u00a0\n%\n$\n54,409\u00a0\n100\u00a0\n%\n________________________________\n1.\nIncludes Agency RMBS, CRT and non-Agency MBS repurchase agreements.\n E\nxcludes U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements totaling $1,547 million and $355 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n2.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 43% and 48%, respectively, of our total repurchase agreements, including 45% and 48% or our investment securities repurchase agreements, respectively, were funded through the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation's GCF Repo service.\nOur primary financing sources are collateralized borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. We enter into repurchase agreements, or \"repo,\" through bi-lateral arrangements with financial institutions and independent dealers. We also enter into third-party repurchase agreements through our wholly-owned registered broker-dealer subsidiary, Bethesda Securities, LLC, such as tri-party repo offered through the FICC's GCF Repo service. We manage our repurchase agreement funding position through a variety of methods, including diversification of counterparties, maintaining a suitable maturity profile and utilization of interest rate hedging strategies. We also use TBA dollar roll transactions as a means of synthetically financing Agency RMBS.\nThe terms and conditions of our repurchase agreements are determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis when each such borrowing is initiated or renewed and, in the case of GCF Repo, by the prevailing margin requirements calculated by the FICC, which acts as the central counterparty. The amount borrowed is generally equal to the fair value of the securities pledged, as determined by the lending counterparty, less an assessed discount, referred to as a \"haircut,\" that reflects the underlying risk of the specific collateral and protects the counterparty against a change in its value. Interest rates are generally fixed based on prevailing rates corresponding to the term of the borrowing. None of our repo counterparties are obligated to renew or otherwise enter into new borrowings at the conclusion of our existing borrowings.\nThe use of TBA dollar roll transactions increases our funding diversification, expands our available pool of assets, and increases our overall liquidity position, as TBA contracts typically have lower implied haircuts relative to Agency RMBS pools funded with repo financing. TBA dollar roll transactions may also have a lower implied cost of funds than comparable repo funded transactions (referred to as \"dollar roll specialness\") offering incremental return potential. However, if it were to become uneconomical to roll our TBA contracts into future months it may be necessary to take physical delivery of the underlying securities and fund those assets with cash or other financing sources, which could reduce our liquidity position. \n41\nCollateral Requirements and Unencumbered Assets\nAmounts available to be borrowed under our repurchase agreements are dependent upon prevailing interest rates, the lender\u2019s \"haircut\" requirements and collateral value. Each of these elements may fluctuate with changes in interest rates, credit quality and liquidity conditions within the financial markets. To help manage the adverse impact of interest rate changes on our borrowings, we utilize an interest rate risk management strategy involving the use of derivative financial instruments. In particular, we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our short-term funding liabilities increasing at a faster rate than the earnings of our long-term fixed rate assets during a period of rising interest rates. \nThe collateral requirements, or haircut levels, under our repo agreements are typically determined on an individual transaction basis or by the prevailing requirements established by the FICC for GCF tri-party repo. Consequently, haircut levels and minimum margin requirements can change over time and may increase during periods of elevated market volatility. If the fair value of our collateral declines, our counterparties will typically require that we post additional collateral to re-establish the agreed-upon collateral levels, referred to as \"margin calls.\" Similarly, if the estimated fair value of our investment securities increases, we may request that counterparties release collateral back to us. Our counterparties typically have the sole discretion to determine the value of pledged collateral but are required to act in good faith in making determinations of value. Our agreements generally provide that in the event of a margin call, collateral must be posted on the same business day, subject to notice requirements. As of December 31, 2023, we had met all our margin requirements.\nThe value of Agency RMBS collateral is impacted by market factors and is reduced by monthly principal pay-downs on the underlying mortgage pools. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac publish monthly security pay-down factors for their mortgage pools on the fifth day after month-end, but do not remit payment to security holders until generally the 25th day after month-end. Bi-lateral repo counterparties assess margin to account for the reduction in value of Agency collateral when factors are released. The FICC assesses margin on the last day of each month, prior to the factor release date, based on its internally projected pay-down rates (referred to as the \"blackout period exposure adjustment\" or \"blackout margin\"). On the factor release date, the blackout margin is released and collateralization requirements are adjusted to actual factor data. Due to the timing difference between associated margin calls and our receipt of principal pay-downs, our liquidity is temporarily reduced each month for principal repayments. We attempt to manage the liquidity risk associated with principal pay-downs by monitoring conditions impacting prepayment rates and through asset selection. As of December 31, 2023, approximately 9% of our investment portfolio consisted of TBA securities, which are not subject to monthly principal pay-downs. The remainder of our portfolio primarily consisted of Agency RMBS, which had an average one-year CPR forecast of 9%. \nCollateral requirements under our derivative agreements are subject to our counterparties' assessment of their maximum risk of loss associated with the derivative instrument, referred to as the initial or minimum margin requirement, and may be adjusted based on changes in market volatility and other factors. We are also subject to daily variation margin requirements based on changes in the value of the derivative instrument and/or collateral pledged. Daily variation margin requirements also entitle us to receive collateral if the value of amounts owed to us under the derivative agreement exceeds the minimum margin requirement. The collateral requirements under our TBA contracts are governed by the Mortgage-Backed Securities Division (\"MBSD\") of the FICC. Collateral levels for interest rate derivative agreements are typically governed by the central clearing exchange and the associated futures commission merchants (\"FCMs\"), which may establish margin levels in excess of the clearing exchange. Collateral levels for interest rate derivative agreements not subject to central clearing are established by the counterparty financial institution. \nHaircut levels and minimum margin requirements imposed by our counterparties reduce the amount of our unencumbered assets and limit the amount we can borrow against our investment securities. During the fiscal year 2023, haircuts on our repo funding arrangements remained stable. As of December 31, 2023, the weighted average haircut on our repurchase agreements was approximately 3.1% of the value of our collateral, compared to 3.7% as of December 31, 2022. \nTo mitigate the risk of margins calls, we seek to maintain excess liquidity by holding unencumbered liquid assets that can be used to satisfy collateral requirements, collateralize additional borrowings or sold for cash. As of December 31, 2023, our unencumbered assets totaled approximately $5.2 billion, or 67% of tangible equity, consisting of $5.1 billion of unencumbered cash and Agency RMBS and $0.1 billion of unencumbered credit assets. This compares to $4.4 billion of unencumbered assets, or 60% of tangible equity, as of December 31, 2022, consisting of $4.3 billion of unencumbered cash and Agency RMBS and $0.1 billion of unencumbered credit assets.\nCounterparty Risk\nCollateral requirements imposed by counterparties subject us to the risk that the counterparty does not return pledged assets to us as and when required. We attempt to manage this risk by monitoring our collateral positions and limiting our counterparties to registered clearinghouses and major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. We also diversify our funding across multiple counterparties and by region. \n42\nAs of December 31, 2023, our maximum amount at risk (or the excess/shortfall of the value of collateral pledged/received over our repurchase agreement liabilities/reverse repurchase agreement receivables) with any of our repurchase agreement counterparties, excluding the FICC, was less than 3% of our tangible stockholders' equity, with our top five repo counterparties, excluding the FICC, representing approximately 7% of our tangible stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2023, less than 7% of our tangible stockholder's equity was at risk with the FICC. Excluding central clearing exchanges, as of December 31, 2023, our amount at risk with any counterparty to our derivative agreements was less than 1% of our stockholders' equity.\nAsset Sales\nAgency RMBS securities are among the most liquid fixed income securities, and the TBA market is the second most liquid market (after the U.S. Treasury market). Although market conditions fluctuate, the vitality of these markets enables us to sell assets under most conditions to generate liquidity through direct sales or delivery into TBA contracts, subject to \"good delivery\" provisions promulgated by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (\"SIFMA\"). Under certain market conditions, however, we may be unable to realize the full carrying value of our securities. We attempt to manage this risk by maintaining at least a minimum level of securities that trade at or near TBA values that in our estimation enhances our portfolio liquidity across a wide range of market conditions. Please refer to \nTrends and Recent Market Impacts\n of this Management Discussion and Analysis for further information regarding Agency RMBS and TBA market conditions.\nCapital Markets\nThe equity capital markets serve as a source of capital to grow our business and to meet potential liquidity needs of our business. The availability of equity capital is dependent on market conditions and investor demand for our common and preferred stock. We will typically not issue common stock at times when we believe the capital raised will not be accretive to our tangible net book value or earnings, and we will typically not issue preferred equity when its cost exceeds acceptable hurdle rates of return on our equity. We may also be unable to raise additional equity capital at suitable times or on favorable terms. Furthermore, when the trading price of our common stock is less than our estimate of our current tangible net book value per common share, among other conditions, we may repurchase shares of our common stock. Please refer to Note 9 of our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details regarding our recent equity capital transactions, if any.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2023, we did not maintain relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, or special purpose or variable interest entities, established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, we had not guaranteed obligations of unconsolidated entities or entered into a commitment or intent to provide funding to such entities.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThe statements contained in this Annual Report that are not historical facts, including estimates, projections, beliefs, expectations concerning conditions, events, or the outlook for our business, strategy, performance, operations or the markets or industries in which we operate, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

",
    "item7a": ">Item 7A.\n Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarket risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. The primary market risks that we are exposed to are interest rate, prepayment, spread, liquidity, extension and credit risks.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the fixed income nature of our assets and the short-term, variable rate nature of our financing obligations. Our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities. The costs associated with our borrowings are generally based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase while the yields earned on our existing portfolio of leveraged fixed-rate assets will largely remain static. This can result in a decline in our net interest spread. Changes in the level of interest rates can also affect the rate of mortgage prepayments and the value of our assets. \nInterest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques to mitigate the influence of interest rate changes on our net interest income and fluctuations of our tangible net book value. The principal instruments that we use to hedge our interest rate risk are interest rate swaps, swaptions, U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. Our hedging techniques are highly complex and are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our assets. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the maturity of our investments will also differ from our expectations, which could reduce the effectiveness of our hedging strategies and may cause losses on such transactions and adversely affect our cash flow. \nThe severity of potential declines in our tangible net book value due to fluctuations in interest rates would depend on our asset, liability, and hedge composition at the time, as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate change. Primary measures of an instrument's price sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations are its duration and convexity. Duration measures the estimated percentage change in market value of an instrument that would be caused by a parallel change in short and long-term interest rates. The duration of our assets will vary with changes in interest rates and tends to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall. This \"negative convexity\" generally increases the interest rate exposure of our investment portfolio in excess of what is measured by duration alone. \nWe estimate the duration and convexity of our assets using a third-party risk management system and market data. We review the estimates for reasonableness, giving consideration to any unique characteristics of our securities, market conditions and other factors likely to impact these estimates, and based on our judgement we may make adjustments to the third-party estimates. Our estimated duration gap, which is a measure of the difference between the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and our liabilities, inclusive of interest rate hedges, was -0.5 years as of December 31, 2023, compared to 0.4 years as of 2022.\nThe table below quantifies the estimated changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio (including derivatives and other securities used for hedging purposes) and in our tangible net book value per common share as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 should interest rates go up or down by 25, 50 and 75 basis points, assuming instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve \n44\nand including the impact of both duration and convexity. All values in the table below are measured as percentage changes from the base interest rate scenario. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates and prepayment projections as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. \nTo the extent that these estimates or other assumptions do not hold true, which may be more likely during periods of elevated market volatility, actual results could differ materially from our projections. Moreover, if different models were employed in the analysis, materially different projections could result. Lastly, while the table below reflects the estimated impact of interest rate changes on a static portfolio, we actively manage our portfolio, and we continuously adjust the size and composition of our asset and hedge portfolio.\n\u00a0\nInterest Rate Sensitivity \n1,2\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nChange in Interest Rate\nEstimated Change in Portfolio Market Value\nEstimated Change in Tangible Net Book Value Per Common Share\nEstimated Change in Portfolio Market Value\nEstimated Change in Tangible Net Book Value Per Common Share\n-75 Basis Points\n-0.7%\n-7.0%\n+0.1%\n+1.4%\n-50 Basis Points\n-0.4%\n-3.8%\n+0.1%\n+1.5%\n-25 Basis Points\n-0.1%\n-1.5%\n+0.1%\n+1.0%\n+25 Basis Points\n0.1%\n+0.7%\n-0.1%\n-1.4%\n+50 Basis Points\n0.1%\n+0.7%\n-0.3%\n-3.3%\n+75 Basis Points\n0.0%\n0.0%\n-0.5%\n-5.4%\n________________________________\n1.\nDerived from models that are dependent on inputs and assumptions, assumes there are no changes in mortgage spreads and assumes a static portfolio. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\n2.\nIncludes the effect of derivatives and other securities used for hedging purposes. Interest rates are assumed to be floored at 0% in down rate scenarios.\nPrepayment Risk and Extension Risk\nPrepayment risk is the risk that our assets will be repaid at a faster rate than anticipated. Interest rates and numerous other factors affect the rate of prepayments, such as housing prices, general economic conditions, loan age, size and loan-to-value ratios, and GSE buyouts of delinquent loans underlying our securities. Generally, declining mortgage rates increase the rate of prepayments, while rising rates have the opposite effect. \nIf our assets prepay at a faster rate than anticipated, we may be unable to reinvest the repayments at acceptable yields. If the proceeds are reinvested at lower yields than our existing assets, our net interest income would be negatively impacted. We also amortize or accrete premiums and discounts we pay or receive at purchase relative to the stated principal of our assets into interest income over their projected lives using the effective interest method. If the actual and estimated future prepayment experience differs from our prior estimates, we are required to record an adjustment to interest income for the impact of the cumulative difference in the effective yield.\nExtension risk is the risk that our assets will be repaid at a slower rate than anticipated and generally increases when interest rates rise. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, we may be required to finance our investments at potentially higher costs without the ability to reinvest principal into higher yielding securities as a result of borrowers prepaying their mortgages at a slower pace than originally anticipated, adversely impacting our net interest spread, and thus our net interest income.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our investment securities (excluding TBAs) had a weighted average projected CPR of 11.4% and 7.4%, respectively, and a weighted average yield of 4.41% and 3.37%, respectively. The table below presents estimated weighted average projected CPRs and yields for our investment securities should interest rates go up or down instantaneously by 25, 50 and 75 basis points. Estimated yields exclude the impact of retroactive \"catch-up\" premium amortization adjustments for prior periods due to changes in the projected CPR assumption. \n45\nInterest Rate Sensitivity \n1\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nChange in Interest Rate\nWeighted Average Projected CPR\nWeighted Average Asset Yield \n2\nWeighted Average Projected CPR\nWeighted Average Asset Yield \n2\n-75 Basis Points\n17.8%\n4.33%\n8.3%\n3.33%\n-50 Basis Points\n15.4%\n4.36%\n7.9%\n3.34%\n-25 Basis Points\n13.2%\n4.39%\n7.6%\n3.36%\n\u00a0\u00a0Actual as of Period End\n11.4%\n4.41%\n7.4%\n3.37%\n+25 Basis Points\n9.7%\n4.44%\n7.2%\n3.38%\n+50 Basis Points\n8.5%\n4.46%\n7.0%\n3.39%\n+75 Basis Points\n7.7%\n4.47%\n6.9%\n3.40%\n________________________________\n1.\nDerived from models that are dependent on inputs and assumptions and assumes a static portfolio. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Table excludes TBA securities.\n2.\nAsset yield based on historical cost basis and does not include the impact of retroactive \"catch-up\" premium amortization adjustments due to changes in projected CPR. \nSpread Risk\nSpread risk is the risk that the market spread between the yield on our assets and the yield on benchmark interest rates linked to our interest rate hedges, such as U.S. Treasury rates and interest rate swap rates, may vary. As a levered investor in mortgage-backed securities, spread risk is an inherent component of our investment strategy. Therefore, although we use hedging instruments to attempt to protect against moves in interest rates, our hedges are generally not designed to protect against spread risk, and our tangible net book value could decline if spreads widen. \nFluctuations in mortgage spreads can occur due to a variety of factors, including changes in interest rates, prepayment expectations, actual or anticipated monetary policy actions by the U.S. and foreign central banks, liquidity conditions, required rates of returns on different assets and other market supply and demand factors. The table below quantifies the estimated changes in the fair value of our assets, net of hedges, and our tangible net book value per common share as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 should spreads widen or tighten by 10, 25 and 50 basis points. The estimated impact of changes in spreads is in addition to our interest rate shock sensitivity included in the interest rate shock table above. The table below assumes a spread duration of 4.7 and 5.8 years as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, based on interest rates and prices as of such dates; however, our portfolio's sensitivity to mortgage spread changes will vary with changes in interest rates and in the size and composition of our portfolio. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from our estimates.\nSpread Sensitivity \n1,2\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nChange in MBS Spread\nEstimated Change in Portfolio Market Value\nEstimated Change in Tangible Net Book Value Per Common Share\nEstimated Change in Portfolio Market Value\nEstimated Change in Tangible Net Book Value Per Common Share\n-50 Basis Points\n+2.3%\n+23.1%\n+2.9%\n+30.6%\n-25 Basis Points\n+1.2%\n+11.6%\n+1.5%\n+15.3%\n-10 Basis Points\n+0.5%\n+4.6%\n+0.6%\n+6.1%\n+10 Basis Points\n-0.5%\n-4.6%\n-0.6%\n-6.1%\n+25 Basis Points\n-1.2%\n-11.6%\n-1.5%\n-15.3%\n+50 Basis Points\n-2.3%\n-23.1%\n-2.9%\n-30.6%\n________________________________\n1.\nSpread sensitivity is derived from models that are dependent on inputs and assumptions, assumes there are no changes in interest rates and assumes a static portfolio. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\n2.\nIncludes the effect of derivatives and other securities used for hedging purposes.\nLiquidity Risk\nOur liquidity risk principally arises from financing long-term fixed rate assets with shorter-term variable rate borrowings.\u00a0Future borrowings are dependent upon the willingness of lenders to finance our investments, lender collateral \n46\nrequirements and the lenders\u2019 determination of the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates and liquidity conditions within the commercial banking and mortgage finance industries.\u00a0\nAs of December 31, 2023, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available to execute our business strategy (see \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n in this Form 10-K for additional details). However, should the value of our collateral or the value of our derivative instruments suddenly decrease, or margin requirements increase, we may be required to post additional collateral for these arrangements, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.\u00a0Furthermore, there is no assurance that we will always be able to renew (or roll) our short-term funding liabilities.\u00a0In addition, our counterparties have the option to increase our haircuts (margin requirements) on the assets we pledge against our funding liabilities, thereby reducing the amount that can be borrowed against an asset even if they agree to renew or roll our funding liabilities.\u00a0Significantly higher haircuts can reduce our ability to leverage our portfolio or may even force us to sell assets, especially if correlated with asset price declines or faster prepayment rates on our assets. \nCredit Risk\nOur credit sensitive investments, such as CRT and non-Agency securities, expose us to the risk of nonpayment of principal, interest or other remuneration we are contractually entitled to. We are also exposed to credit risk in the event our repurchase agreement counterparties default on their obligations to resell the underlying collateral back to us at the end of the repo term or in the event our derivative counterparties do not perform under the terms of our derivative agreements.\nWe accept credit exposure related to our credit sensitive assets at levels we deem prudent within the context of our overall investment strategy. We attempt to manage this risk through careful asset selection, pre-acquisition due diligence, post-acquisition performance monitoring, and the sale of assets where we identify negative credit trends. We may also manage credit risk with credit default swaps or other financial derivatives that we believe are appropriate. Additionally, we may vary the mix of our interest rate and credit sensitive assets or our duration gap to adjust our credit exposure and/or improve the return profile of our assets, such as when we believe credit performance is inversely correlated with changes in interest rates. Our credit risk related to derivative and repurchase agreement transactions is largely mitigated by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings or to registered central clearinghouses and monitoring concentration levels with any one counterparty. We also continuously monitor and adjust the amount of collateral pledged based on changes in market value. However, our efforts to manage credit risk may be unsuccessful and we could suffer losses as a result. Excluding central clearing exchanges, as of December 31, 2023, our maximum amount at risk with any counterparty related to our repurchase agreements and derivative agreements was less than 3% and 1%, respectively, of tangible stockholders' equity. \n47",

Our management also prepared the related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is responsible for its accuracy and consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\u00a0\nThe consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 have been audited by Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who conducted their audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The independent registered public accounting firm's responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on their audits. For further information refer to the Ernst & Young LLP (PCAOB ID: \n42\n) audit opinion included in this Item 8 of our Annual Report. \n\u00a0\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \n\u00a0\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)\u00a0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and Board of Directors; and (iii)\u00a0provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. \n\u00a0\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n\u00a0\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on this assessment and those criteria, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report included in this Form 10-K. \n48\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AGNC Investment Corp.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited AGNC Investment Corp.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AGNC Investment Corp. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\n \nthe COSO criteria\n.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes, and our report dated February\u00a022, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nTysons, Virginia\nFebruary\u00a022, 2024\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n49\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AGNC Investment Corp.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AGNC Investment Corp. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February\u00a022, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n50\nAgency securities and non-agency securities of high credit quality net premium amortization\nDescription \nof the Matter\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s investment securities had a net unamortized premium balance of $1.2 billion, including interest and principal-only securities, and it recorded $201 million of net premium amortization for the year then ended. As explained in Note 2 to the financial statements, premiums or discounts associated with the purchase of Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (\u201cAgency RMBS\") and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities of high credit quality are amortized or accreted into interest income, respectively, over the projected lives of the securities, including contractual payments and estimated prepayments using the effective interest method. The effective yield on the Company\u2019s Agency RMBS and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities of high credit quality is highly impacted by the Company\u2019s estimate of future prepayments. The Company estimates long-term prepayment speeds of such securities using a third-party service provider and market data. The third-party service provider estimates long-term prepayment speeds using a prepayment model that incorporates the forward yield curve, current mortgage rates, mortgage rates of the outstanding loans, age and size of the outstanding loans, loan-to-value ratios, interest rate volatility and other factors. \nAuditing the Company's estimation of long-term prepayment speeds used for the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is subjective due to the significant judgments and estimates required by management and the third-party service provider, as inputs into prepayment models are prone to fluctuation based on changing macroeconomic conditions. \nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the estimation of long-term prepayment speeds, including management\u2019s review of the estimated prepayment speeds provided by the third-party service provider. \nOur audit procedures included, among others, performing comparative analyses between the Company\u2019s long-term prepayment speed estimates and long-term prepayment speed estimates data from independent third-party sources, reconciling the Company\u2019s estimates of long-term prepayment speeds to source prepayment speeds data provided by management\u2019s third-party service provider, evaluating the competency and objectivity of management\u2019s third-party service provider, and identifying potential sources of contrary information, with the assistance of an internal valuation specialist.

(referred throughout this report as the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us\" and \"our\") was organized in Delaware on January\u00a07, 2008 and commenced operations on May\u00a020, 2008 following the completion of our initial public offering. Our common stock is traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"AGNC.\"\nWe are a leading provider of private capital to the U.S. housing market, enhancing liquidity in the residential real estate mortgage markets and, in turn, facilitating home ownership in the U.S. We invest primarily in Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (\"Agency RMBS\") for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise (\"GSE\") or a U.S. Government agency. We also invest in other types of mortgage and mortgage-related securities, such as credit risk transfer (\"CRT\") securities and non-Agency residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities (\"non-Agency RMBS\" and \"CMBS,\" respectively), where repayment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency, and other assets related to the housing, mortgage or real estate markets. We fund our investments primarily through collateralized borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. \nWe operate to qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (\"REIT\") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Internal Revenue Code\"). As a REIT, we are required to distribute annually \n90\n% of our taxable income, and we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate income tax to the extent that we distribute our annual taxable income to our stockholders on a timely basis. It is our intention to distribute \n100\n% of our taxable income within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent tax year.\n \nWe are internally managed with the principal objective of generating favorable long-term stockholder returns with a substantial yield component. We generate income from the interest earned on our investments, net of associated borrowing and hedging costs, and net realized gains and losses on our investment and hedging activities.\nNote 2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\").\u00a0Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\u00a0\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \nInvestment Securities\nAgency RMBS consist of residential mortgage pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (\"CMOs\") guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\"), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac,\" and together with Fannie Mae, the \"GSEs\") or the Government National Mortgage Association (\"Ginnie Mae\").\nCRT securities are risk sharing instruments issued by the GSEs, and similarly structured transactions issued by third-party market participants, that synthetically transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses within pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or third parties to private investors. Unlike Agency RMBS, full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency; rather, \"credit risk transfer\" is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT securities if credit losses on a related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds. By reducing the amount that they are obligated to repay to holders of CRT securities, the GSEs and/or other third parties offset credit losses on the related loans. \nNon-Agency RMBS and CMBS (together, \"Non-Agency MBS\") are backed by residential and commercial mortgage loans, respectively, packaged and securitized by a private institution, such as a commercial bank. Non-Agency MBS typically benefit from credit enhancements derived from structural elements, such as subordination, over-collateralization or insurance, but nonetheless carry a higher level of credit exposure than Agency RMBS. \n56\nAll of our securities are reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet. Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 320, \nInvestments\u2014Debt and Equity Securities\n, requires that at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale or trading, depending on our ability and intent to hold such security to maturity. Alternatively, we may elect the fair value option of accounting for securities pursuant to ASC Topic 825, \nFinancial Instruments\n. Prior to fiscal year 2017, we primarily designated our investment securities as available-for-sale. On January 1, 2017, we began electing the fair value option of accounting for all investment securities newly acquired after such date. Unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as available-for-sale are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"OCI\"), whereas unrealized gains and losses on securities for which we elected the fair value option, or are classified as trading, are reported in net income through other gain (loss). Upon the sale of a security designated as available-for-sale, we determine the cost of the security and the amount of unrealized gain or loss to reclassify out of accumulated OCI into earnings based on the specific identification method. In our view, the election of the fair value option simplifies the accounting for investment securities and more appropriately reflects the results of our operations for a reporting period by presenting the fair value changes for these assets in a manner consistent with the presentation and timing of the fair value changes for our derivative instruments.\nWe generally recognize gains or losses through net income on available-for-sale securities only if the security is sold; however, if the fair value of a security declines below its amortized cost and we determine that it is more likely than not that we will incur a realized loss on the security when we sell the asset, we will recognize the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value in net income as a component of other gain (loss). As of December 31, 2023, we did not intend to sell available-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position and it was not more likely than not that we would be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. Since all of our available-for-sale designated securities consist of Agency RMBS, we do not have an allowance for credit losses. We have not recognized impairment losses on our available-for-sale securities through net income for the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.\n \nInterest Income\nInterest income is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount of the investment securities and their contractual terms. Premiums or discounts associated with the purchase of Agency RMBS and non-Agency MBS of high credit quality are amortized or accreted into interest income, respectively, over the projected lives of the securities, including contractual payments and estimated prepayments, using the effective interest method in accordance with ASC Subtopic 310-20, \nReceivables\u2014Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs\n.\nWe estimate long-term prepayment speeds of our mortgage securities using a third-party service and market data. The third-party service provider estimates prepayment speeds using models that incorporate the forward yield curve, primary to secondary mortgage rate spreads, current mortgage rates, mortgage rates of the outstanding loans, age and size of the outstanding loans, loan-to-value ratios, interest rate volatility and other factors. We review the prepayment speeds estimated by the third-party service for reasonableness with consideration given to both historical prepayment speeds and current market conditions. If based on our assessment, we believe that the third-party model does not fully reflect our expectations of the current prepayment landscape we may make adjustments to the models. We review our actual and anticipated prepayment experience on at least a quarterly basis and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between (i) our previous estimate of future prepayments and (ii) actual prepayments to date and our current estimate of future prepayments. We are required to record an adjustment in the current period to premium amortization / discount accretion for the cumulative effect of the difference in the effective yields as if the recalculated yield had been in place as of the security's acquisition date through the reporting date.\nAt the time we purchase CRT securities and non-Agency MBS that are not of high credit quality, we determine an effective yield based on our estimate of the timing and amount of future cash flows and our cost basis. Our initial cash flow estimates for these investments are based on our observations of current information and events and include assumptions related to interest rates, prepayment rates, collateral call provisions, and the impact of default and severity rates on the timing and amount of credit losses. On at least a quarterly basis, we review the estimated cash flows and make appropriate adjustments based on inputs and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment regarding such inputs and other factors. Any resulting changes in effective yield are recognized prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment adjusted for credit impairments, if any.\nRepurchase Agreements\n\u00a0\nWe finance the acquisition of securities for our investment portfolio primarily through repurchase agreements with our lending counterparties. Repurchase arrangements involve the sale and a simultaneous agreement to repurchase the securities at a future date. We maintain a beneficial interest in the specific securities pledged during the term of each repurchase arrangement and we receive the related principal and interest payments. Pursuant to ASC Topic 860, \nTransfers and Servicing\n, we account for \n57\nrepurchase agreements as collateralized financing transactions, which are carried at their contractual amounts (cost), plus accrued interest. Our repurchase agreements typically have maturities of less than one year.\nReverse Repurchase Agreements\u00a0and Obligation to Return Securities Borrowed under Reverse Repurchase Agreements\nWe borrow securities to cover short sales of U.S. Treasury securities through reverse repurchase transactions under our master repurchase agreements (see \nDerivative Instruments\n below). We account for these as securities borrowing transactions and recognize an obligation to return the borrowed securities at fair value on the balance sheet based on the value of the underlying borrowed securities as of the reporting date. We may also enter into reverse repurchase agreements to earn a yield on excess cash balances. The securities received as collateral in connection with our reverse repurchase agreements mitigate our credit risk exposure to counterparties. Our reverse repurchase agreements typically have maturities of 30 days or less.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe use a variety of derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension and liquidity risks. The objective of our risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in net book value over a range of interest rate scenarios. In particular, we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our variable rate liabilities increasing during a period of rising interest rates. The primary instruments that we use are interest rate swaps, options to enter into interest rate swaps (\"swaptions\"), U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts. We also use forward contracts in the Agency RMBS \"to-be-announced\" market, or TBA securities, to invest in and finance Agency securities and to periodically reduce our exposure to Agency RMBS. \nWe account for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 815, \nDerivatives and Hedging \n(\"ASC 815\"). ASC 815 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value. None of our derivative instruments have been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes under the provisions of ASC 815, consequently changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are reported in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nOur derivative agreements generally contain provisions that allow for netting or setting off derivative assets and liabilities with the counterparty; however, we report related assets and liabilities on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets. Derivative instruments in a gain position are reported as derivative assets at fair value and derivative instruments in a loss position are reported as derivative liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments and periodic settlements related to our derivative instruments are recorded in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net cash receipts from and payments on our derivative instruments are classified in our consolidated statements of cash flows according to the underlying nature or purpose of the derivative transaction, generally in the investing section. \nInterest rate swap agreements\nWe use interest rate swaps to economically hedge the variable cash flows associated with our borrowings made under repurchase agreements. Under our interest rate swap agreements, we typically pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate (\"payer swaps\") based on a short-term benchmark rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") and Overnight Index Swap Rate (\"OIS\"). Our interest rate swaps typically have terms from one to 10 years. Our interest rate swaps are centrally cleared through a registered commodities exchange. The clearing exchange requires that we post an \"initial margin\" amount determined by the exchange. The initial margin amount is intended to be set at a level sufficient to protect the exchange from the interest rate swap's maximum estimated single-day price movement and is subject to adjustment based on changes in market volatility and other factors. We also exchange daily settlements of \"variation margin\" based upon changes in fair value, as measured by the exchange. Pursuant to rules governing central clearing activities, we recognize variation margin settlements as a direct reduction of the carrying value of the interest rate swap asset or liability. \nInterest rate swaptions\nWe purchase interest rate swaptions to help mitigate the potential impact of larger, more rapid changes in interest rates on the performance of our investment portfolio. Interest rate swaptions provide us the option to enter into an interest rate swap agreement for a predetermined notional amount, stated term and pay and receive interest rates in the future. Our interest rate swaption agreements are not subject to central clearing. The difference between the premium paid and the fair value of the swaption is reported in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. If a swaption expires unexercised, the realized loss on the swaption would be equal to the premium paid. If we sell or exercise a swaption, the realized gain or loss on the swaption would be equal to the difference between the cash or the fair value of the underlying interest rate swap and the premium paid.\n58\nTBA securities\nA TBA security is a forward contract for the purchase or sale of Agency RMBS at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date. The specific Agency RMBS to be delivered into the contract are not known until shortly before the settlement date. We may choose, prior to settlement, to move the settlement of these securities out to a later date by entering into an offsetting TBA position, net settling the offsetting positions for cash, and simultaneously purchasing or selling a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date (together referred to as a \"dollar roll transaction\"). The Agency securities purchased or sold for a forward settlement date are typically priced at a discount to equivalent securities settling in the current month. This difference, or \"price drop,\" is the economic equivalent of interest income on the underlying Agency securities, less an implied funding cost, over the forward settlement period (referred to as \"dollar roll income\"). Consequently, forward purchases of Agency securities and dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing. \nWe account for TBA contracts as derivative instruments since either the TBA contracts do not settle in the shortest period of time possible or we cannot assert that it is probable at inception and throughout the term of the TBA contract that we will physically settle the contract on the settlement date. We account for TBA dollar roll transactions as a series of derivative transactions. \nU.S. Treasury securities and US Treasury futures contracts\nWe use U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts to mitigate the potential impact of changes in interest rates on the performance of our portfolio. We enter into short-sales of U.S. Treasury securities by borrowing the securities under reverse repurchase agreements and selling them into the market. We account for these as securities borrowing transactions and recognize an obligation to return the borrowed securities at fair value on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on the value of the underlying U.S. Treasury security as of the reporting date. Treasury futures contracts are standardized contracts that obligate us to sell or buy U.S. Treasury securities for future delivery. Gains and losses associated with U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts are recognized in gain (loss) on derivative instruments and other securities, net in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nFair Value Measurements\n \nWe determine the fair value of financial instruments based on our estimate of the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We utilize a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of the instrument as of the measurement date. We categorize a financial instrument within the hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. \nThe three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\u2022\nLevel 1 Inputs \u2014Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical unrestricted assets and liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date.\n\u2022\nLevel 2 Inputs \u2014Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\n\u2022\nLevel 3 Inputs \u2014Instruments with primarily unobservable market data that cannot be corroborated.\nThe majority of our financial instruments are classified as Level 2 inputs. The availability of observable inputs can be affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace and other characteristics particular to the instrument. We typically obtain price estimates from multiple third-party pricing sources, such as pricing services and dealers, or, if applicable, from the registered clearing exchange. We make inquiries of third-party pricing sources to understand the significant inputs and assumptions they used to determine their prices and that they are derived from orderly transactions, particularly during periods of elevated market turbulence and reduced market liquidity. We also review third-party price estimates and perform procedures to validate their reasonableness, including an analysis of the range of estimates for each position, comparison to recent trade activity for similar securities and for consistency with market conditions observed as of the measurement date. While we do not adjust prices we obtain from pricing sources, we will exclude prices for securities from our estimation of fair value if we determine based on our validation procedures and our market knowledge and expertise that the price is significantly different from what observable market data \n59\nwould indicate and we cannot obtain an understanding from the third-party source as to the significant inputs used to determine the price.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis classified as Level 2 inputs. These instruments trade in active markets such that participants transact with sufficient frequency and volume to provide transparent pricing information on an ongoing basis. The liquidity of these markets and the similarity of our instruments to those actively traded enable our pricing sources and us to utilize the observed quoted prices as a basis for formulating fair value measurements. \nInvestment securities\n - are valued based on prices obtained from multiple third-party pricing sources. The pricing sources utilize various valuation approaches, including market and income approaches. For Agency RMBS, the pricing sources primarily utilize a matrix pricing technique that interpolates the estimated fair value based on observed quoted prices for forward contracts in the TBA market of the same coupon, maturity and issuer, adjusted to reflect the specific characteristics of the pool of mortgages underlying the Agency security, such as maximum loan balance, loan vintage, loan-to-value ratio, geography and other characteristics as may be appropriate. For other investment securities, the pricing sources primarily utilize discounted cash flow model-derived pricing techniques to estimate the fair value. Such models incorporate market-based discount rate assumptions based on observable inputs such as recent trading activity, credit data, volatility statistics, benchmark interest rate curves, spread measurements to benchmark curves and other market data that are current as of the measurement date and may include certain unobservable inputs, such as assumptions of future levels of prepayment, defaults and loss severities. \nTBA securities\n - are valued using prices obtained from third-party pricing sources based on pricing models that reference recent trading activity.\nInterest rate swaps\n - are valued using the daily settlement price, or fair value, determined by the clearing exchange based on a pricing model that references observable market inputs, including current benchmark rates and the forward yield curve. \nInterest rate swaptions\n - are valued using prices obtained from the counterparty and other third-party pricing models. The pricing models are based on the value of the future interest rate swap that we have the option to enter into as well as the remaining length of time that we have to exercise the option based on observable market inputs, adjusted for non-performance risk, if any. \nU.S. Treasury securities and futures are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets and are classified as Level 1 assets. None of our financial instruments are classified as Level 3 inputs.\n \nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities\nASC Topic 810,\n Consolidation\n (\"ASC 810\"), requires an enterprise to consolidate a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") if it is deemed the primary beneficiary of the VIE. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidation of certain VIEs for which we have determined we are the primary beneficiary. The consolidated VIEs consist of CMO trusts backed by fixed or adjustable-rate Agency RMBS. Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guarantees the payment of interest and principal and acts as the trustee and administrator of their respective securitization trusts. Accordingly, we are not required to provide the beneficial interest holders of the CMO securities any financial or other support. Our maximum exposure to loss related to our involvement with the CMO trusts is the fair value of the CMO securities and interest and principal-only securities held by us, less principal amounts guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\u00a0\nCash\u00a0and\u00a0cash\u00a0equivalents\u00a0include\u00a0cash\u00a0held\u00a0in\u00a0bank\u00a0accounts\u00a0and\u00a0cash\u00a0held\u00a0in\u00a0money\u00a0market\u00a0funds\u00a0on\u00a0an\u00a0overnight\u00a0basis.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash includes cash pledged as collateral for clearing and executing trades, repurchase agreements, and interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments.\n \nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the cost of an acquisition in excess of the fair value of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is recognized as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $\n526\n million of goodwill related to our acquisition of AGNC Management, LLC, our former manager, on July 1, 2016. Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be tested for impairment at least annually and at interim periods when events or circumstances may make it more likely than not that an impairment has occurred. If a qualitative analysis indicates that there may be an \n60\nimpairment, a quantitative analysis is performed.\u00a0The quantitative analysis requires that we compare the carrying value of the identified reporting unit comprising the goodwill to the reporting unit's fair value.\u00a0If the reporting unit's carrying value is greater than its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value.\u00a0During the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2023, we did not recognize a goodwill impairment charge.\n \nStock-Based Compensation \nUnder our Amended and Restated AGNC Investment Corp. 2016 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the \"2016 Equity Plan\" or \"the Plan\"), we may grant equity-based compensation to our officers and other employees and non-employee directors for the purpose of providing incentives and rewards for service or performance. Stock-based awards issued under the Plan include time-based and performance-based restricted stock unit awards (\"RSU\" and \"PSU\" awards, respectively), but may include other forms of equity-based compensation. RSU and PSU awards are an agreement to issue an equivalent number of shares of our common stock, plus any equivalent shares for dividends declared on our common stock, at the time the award vests, or later if distribution of such shares has been deferred beyond the vesting date. RSU awards vest over a specified service period. PSU awards vest over a specified service period subject to achieving long-term performance criteria. \nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees and non-employee directors based on their fair values. We value RSU and PSU awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized over each award\u2019s respective service period. For PSU awards, we estimate the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved and recognize expense only for those awards expected to vest. We reevaluate our estimates each reporting period and recognize a cumulative effect adjustment to expense if our estimates change from the prior period. We do not estimate forfeiture rates; rather, we adjust for forfeitures in the periods in which they occur. \nShares underlying RSU and PSU awards are issued when the awards vest, or later if distribution of such shares has been deferred beyond the vest date. Shares issued are net of shares withheld to cover minimum statutory tax withholding obligations. The fair value of shares withheld for tax withholdings is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs issued by the FASB. There are no unadopted ASUs that are expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted or other recently adopted ASUs that had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nNote 3. \nInvestment Securities\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our investment portfolio consisted of $54.8 billion and $40.9 billion investment securities, at fair value, respectively, $\n5.4\n billion and $\n18.6\n billion net TBA securities, at fair value, respectively, and other mortgage credit investments of $\n44\n million and $\n25\n million, respectively, which we account for under the equity method of accounting. Our TBA position is reported at its net carrying value totaling $\n66\n million and $\n167\n million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, in derivative assets / (liabilities) on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The net carrying value of our TBA position represents the difference between the fair value of the underlying security and the cost basis or the forward price to be paid or received for the underlying security. \nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, our investment securities had a net unamortized premium balance of $\n1.2\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion, respectively.\n61\nThe following tables summarize our investment securities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, excluding TBA securities and other mortgage credit investments (dollars in millions).

underlying Agency RMBS issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, which were subject to their underwriting standards. \nThe actual maturities of our investment securities are generally shorter than their stated contractual maturities. The actual maturities of our Agency and high credit quality non-Agency RMBS are primarily affected by principal prepayments and to a lesser degree the contractual lives of the underlying mortgages and periodic contractual principal repayments. The actual maturities of our credit-oriented investments are primarily impacted by their contractual lives and default and loss recovery rates. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the weighted average expected constant prepayment rate (\"CPR\") over the remaining life of our Agency and high credit quality non-Agency RMBS investment portfolio was \n11.4\n% and \n7.4\n%, respectively. Our estimates can differ materially for different securities and thus our individual holdings have a wide range of projected CPRs. \nThe following table summarizes our investments as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 according to their estimated weighted average life classification (dollars in millions):\n63\n\u00a0\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nEstimated Weighted Average Life of Investment Securities \n1\nFair Value\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nCoupon\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\nFair Value\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nCoupon\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\n\u2264 3 years\n$\n942\n\u00a0\n$\n961\n\u00a0\n6.61\n%\n5.93\n%\n$\n512\n\u00a0\n$\n537\n\u00a0\n5.19\n%\n4.66\n%\n> 3 years and \u2264 5 years\n10,381\n\u00a0\n10,331\n\u00a0\n5.98\n%\n5.52\n%\n2,643\n\u00a0\n2,824\n\u00a0\n4.57\n%\n3.79\n%\n> 5 years and \u226410 years\n40,895\n\u00a0\n42,988\n\u00a0\n4.55\n%\n4.10\n%\n30,958\n\u00a0\n33,985\n\u00a0\n3.96\n%\n3.30\n%\n> 10 years\n2,606\n\u00a0\n2,685\n\u00a0\n4.77\n%\n4.63\n%\n6,791\n\u00a0\n7,534\n\u00a0\n3.56\n%\n3.43\n%\nTotal\n$\n54,824\n\u00a0\n$\n56,965\n\u00a0\n4.86\n%\n4.41\n%\n$\n40,904\n\u00a0\n$\n44,880\n\u00a0\n3.94\n%\n3.37\n%\n\u00a0________________________________\n1.\nTable excludes other mortgage credit investments of $\n44\n million and $\n25\n million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table presents the gross unrealized loss and fair values of securities classified as available-for-sale by length of time that such securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions): \n\u00a0\nUnrealized Loss Position For\n\u00a0\nLess than 12 Months\n12 Months or More\nTotal\nSecurities Classified as Available-for-Sale\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLoss\nFair\u00a0Value\nUnrealized\nLoss\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nLoss\nDecember 31, 2023\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n4,797\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n517\n)\n$\n4,797\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n517\n)\nDecember 31, 2022\n$\n5,846\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n665\n)\n$\n52\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n5,898\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n672\n)\nGains and Losses on Sale of Investment Securities\nThe following table is a summary of our net gain (loss) from the sale of investment securities for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 by investment classification of accounting (in millions):\nFiscal Year 2023\nFiscal Year 2022\nFiscal Year 2021\nInvestment Securities\nAvailable-for-Sale \nSecurities \n2,3\nFair Value Option Securities\nTotal\nAvailable-for-Sale \nSecurities \n2,3\nFair Value Option Securities\nTotal\nAvailable-for-Sale \nSecurities \n2,3\nFair Value Option Securities\nTotal\nInvestment securities sold, at cost\n$\n(\n524\n)\n$\n(\n15,263\n)\n$\n(\n15,787\n)\n$\n(\n786\n)\n$\n(\n29,427\n)\n$\n(\n30,213\n)\n$\n(\n4,972\n)\n$\n(\n30,903\n)\n$\n(\n35,875\n)\nProceeds from investment securities sold \n1\n461\n\u00a0\n13,759\n\u00a0\n14,220\n\u00a0\n744\n\u00a0\n26,553\n\u00a0\n27,297\n\u00a0\n5,008\n\u00a0\n30,810\n\u00a0\n35,818\n\u00a0\nNet gain (loss) on sale of investment securities\n$\n(\n63\n)\n$\n(\n1,504\n)\n$\n(\n1,567\n)\n$\n(\n42\n)\n$\n(\n2,874\n)\n$\n(\n2,916\n)\n$\n36\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n93\n)\n$\n(\n57\n)\nGross gain on sale of investment securities\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n19\n\u00a0\n$\n19\n\u00a0\n$\n2\n\u00a0\n$\n10\n\u00a0\n$\n12\n\u00a0\n$\n36\n\u00a0\n$\n176\n\u00a0\n$\n212\n\u00a0\nGross loss on sale of investment securities\n(\n63\n)\n(\n1,523\n)\n(\n1,586\n)\n(\n44\n)\n(\n2,884\n)\n(\n2,928\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n(\n269\n)\n(\n269\n)\nNet gain (loss) on sale of investment securities\n$\n(\n63\n)\n$\n(\n1,504\n)\n$\n(\n1,567\n)\n$\n(\n42\n)\n$\n(\n2,874\n)\n$\n(\n2,916\n)\n$\n36\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n93\n)\n$\n(\n57\n)\n\u00a0________________________________\n1.\nProceeds include cash received during the period, plus receivable for investment securities sold during the period as of period end.\n2.\nSee Note 9 for a summary of changes in accumulated OCI.\n3.\nDuring fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, we received principal repayments on available-for-sale securities of $\n704\n million, $\n1,501\n million and $\n3,574\n million, respectively.\n \u00a0\nNote 4. \nRepurchase Agreements and Reverse Repurchase Agreements\nRepurchase Agreements\nWe pledge our securities as collateral under our borrowings structured as repurchase agreements with financial institutions. Amounts available to be borrowed are dependent upon the fair value of the securities pledged as collateral, which fluctuates with changes in interest rates, type of security and liquidity conditions within the banking, mortgage finance and real estate industries. If the fair value of our pledged securities declines, lenders will typically require us to post additional collateral or pay down borrowings to re-establish agreed upon collateral requirements, referred to as \"margin calls.\" Similarly, if the fair value of our pledged securities increases, lenders may release collateral back to us. As of December 31, 2023, we had met all margin call requirements. For additional information regarding our pledged assets, please refer to Note 6. \n64\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $\n50.4\n billion and $\n36.3\n billion, respectively, of repurchase agreements outstanding used to fund our investment portfolio and temporary holdings of U.S. Treasury securities.

Our derivative contracts similarly require us to fully collateralize our obligations under such agreements, which will vary over time based on similar factors as well as our counterparties' determination of the value of the derivative contract. We are typically required to post initial margin upon execution of derivative transactions, such as under our interest rate swap agreements and TBA contracts, and subsequently post or receive variation margin based on daily fluctuations in fair value. Our brokerage and custody agreements and the clearing organizations utilized by our wholly-owned captive broker-dealer subsidiary, Bethesda Securities, LLC, also require that we post minimum daily clearing deposits. If we breach our collateral requirements, we will be required to fully settle our obligations under the agreements, which could include a forced liquidation of our pledged collateral. \nOur counterparties also apply a \"haircut\" to our pledged collateral, which means our collateral is valued at slightly less than market value and limits the amount we can borrow against our securities. This haircut reflects the underlying risk of the specific collateral and protects our counterparty against a change in its value. Our agreements do not specify the haircut; rather, haircuts are determined on an individual transaction basis. Consequently, our funding agreements and derivative contracts expose us to credit risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized if our counterparties fail to perform their obligations under such agreements. We minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings or to registered clearinghouses and U.S. government agencies, and we monitor our positions with individual counterparties. In the event of a default by a counterparty, we may have difficulty obtaining our assets pledged as collateral to such counterparty and may not receive payments as and when due to us under the terms of our derivative agreements. In the case of centrally cleared instruments, we could be exposed to credit risk if the central clearing agency or a clearing member defaults on its respective obligation to perform under the contract. However, we believe that the risk is minimal due to the clearing exchanges' initial and daily mark-to-market margin requirements, clearinghouse guarantee funds and other resources that are available in the event of a clearing member default. \n69\nAs of December 31, 2023, our maximum amount at risk with any counterparty related to our repurchase agreements, excluding the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, was less than \n3\n% of our tangible stockholders' equity (or the excess/shortfall of the value of collateral pledged/received over our repurchase agreement liabilities/reverse repurchase agreement receivables). As of December 31, 2023, less than \n7\n% of our tangible stockholder's equity was at risk with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. \nAssets Pledged to Counterparties\nThe following tables summarize our assets pledged as collateral under our funding, derivative and brokerage and clearing agreements by type, including securities pledged related to securities sold but not yet settled, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions):\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets Pledged to Counterparties \n1\nRepurchase Agreements \n2\nDebt of \nConsolidated \nVIEs\nDerivative Agreements and Other\nTotal\nAgency RMBS - fair value\n$\n49,602\n\u00a0\n$\n121\n\u00a0\n$\n15\n\u00a0\n$\n49,738\n\u00a0\nCRT - fair value\n678\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n678\n\u00a0\nNon-Agency - fair value\n262\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n262\n\u00a0\nU.S. Treasury securities - fair value\n1,865\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n62\n\u00a0\n1,927\n\u00a0\nAccrued interest on pledged securities\n217\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n217\n\u00a0\nRestricted cash\n9\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n1,244\n\u00a0\n1,253\n\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n52,633\n\u00a0\n$\n121\n\u00a0\n$\n1,321\n\u00a0\n$\n54,075\n\u00a0\nDecember 31, 2022\nAssets Pledged to Counterparties \n1\nRepurchase Agreements \n2\nDebt of \nConsolidated \nVIEs\nDerivative Agreements and Other\nTotal\nAgency RMBS - fair value\n$\n35,765\n\u00a0\n$\n144\n\u00a0\n$\n203\n\u00a0\n$\n36,112\n\u00a0\nCRT - fair value\n703\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n703\n\u00a0\nNon-Agency - fair value\n605\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n605\n\u00a0\nU.S. Treasury securities - fair value\n353\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n353\n\u00a0\nAccrued interest on pledged securities\n127\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n128\n\u00a0\nRestricted cash\n211\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n1,105\n1,316\n\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n37,764\n\u00a0\n$\n145\n\u00a0\n$\n1,308\n\u00a0\n$\n39,217\n\u00a0\n________________________________\n1.\nIncludes repledged assets received as collateral from counterparties and securities sold but not yet settled.\n2.\nIncludes $\n42\n million and $\n49\n million of retained interests in our consolidated VIEs pledged as collateral under repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \nThe following table summarizes our securities pledged as collateral under our repurchase agreements by the remaining maturity of our borrowings, including securities pledged related to sold but not yet settled securities, as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 (in millions).

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the net fair value of our credit default swaps excluding the recognition of variation margin settlements was $(\n6\n) million and $(\n2\n) million, respectively, based on \"Level 2\" inputs. See Notes 2 and 5 for additional details.\nExcluded from the table above are financial instruments reported at cost and other mortgage credit investments reported under the equity method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair \n72\nvalue of our repurchase agreements approximated cost, as the rates on our outstanding repurchase agreements largely corresponded to prevailing rates observed in the repo market. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, receivables and other payables were determined to approximate cost as of such dates due to their short duration. We estimate the fair value of these instruments carried at cost using \"Level 1\" or \"Level 2\" inputs. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the carrying value of other mortgage credit investments reported under the equity method of accounting was $\n44\n million and $\n25\n million, respectively.\n \nNote 8. \nNet Income (Loss) Per Common Share \nBasic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing (i) net income (loss) available (attributable) to common stockholders by (ii) the sum of our weighted-average number of common shares outstanding and the weighted-average number of vested but not yet issued time and performance-based restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") outstanding for the period granted under our long-term incentive program to employees and non-employee Board of Directors. Diluted net income (loss) per common share assumes the issuance of all potential common stock equivalents unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase the income per common share. Our potential common stock equivalents consist of unvested time and performance-based RSUs. The following table presents the computations of basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share for the periods indicated (shares and dollars in millions):\nFiscal Year\n2023\n2022\n2021\nWeighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding\n616.6\n\u00a0\n535.4\n\u00a0\n526.5\n\u00a0\nWeighted average number of fully vested restricted stock units outstanding\n1.8\n\u00a0\n1.6\n\u00a0\n1.6\n\u00a0\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic\n618.4\n\u00a0\n537.0\n\u00a0\n528.1\n\u00a0\nWeighted average number of dilutive unvested restricted stock units outstanding\n1.2\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1.9\n\u00a0\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - diluted\n619.6\n\u00a0\n537.0\n530.0\nNet income (loss) available (attributable) to common stockholders\n$\n32\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n1,295\n)\n$\n649\n\u00a0\nNet income (loss) per common share - basic\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n2.41\n)\n$\n1.23\n\u00a0\nNet income (loss) per common share - diluted\n$\n0.05\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n2.41\n)\n$\n1.22\n\u00a0\nFor fiscal year 2022 \n1.1\n million of potentially dilutive unvested time and performance based RSUs outstanding were excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per common share because to do so would have been anti-dilutive for the period.\nNote 9. \nStockholders' Equity\nPreferred Stock\nWe are authorized to designate and issue up to \n10.0\n million shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series.

Each share of preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share ($25 per depositary share). \nOur preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon a voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Our preferred stock has no stated maturity, is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and each series of preferred stock ranks on parity with one another. Under certain circumstances upon a change of control, our preferred stock is convertible to shares of our common stock. Holders of our preferred stock and depositary shares underlying our preferred stock have no voting rights, except under limited conditions. Beginning on each series' optional redemption date, we may redeem shares at $\n25.00\n per depositary share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared), exclusively at our option. \nThe following table includes a summary of preferred stock depositary shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 (dollars and shares in millions):\n73\nCumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock \n1\nIssue Date\nDepositary\nShares\nIssued\nand\nOutstanding\nCarrying\nValue\n\u00a0Aggregate\nLiquidation Preference\nPer Annum Dividend\nRate \n2,3\nFirst Optional\nRedemption Date / Conversion Date \n3,4\nFixed-to-Floating Rate:\nSeries C\nAugust 22, 2017\n13.0\n\u00a0\n$\n315\n\u00a0\n$\n325\n\u00a0\n10.775\n%\nOctober 15, 2022\nSeries D\nMarch 6, 2019\n9.4\n\u00a0\n227\n\u00a0\n235\n\u00a0\n6.875\n%\nApril 15, 2024\nSeries E\nOctober 3, 2019\n16.1\n\u00a0\n390\n\u00a0\n403\n\u00a0\n6.500\n%\nOctober 15, 2024\nSeries F\nFebruary 11, 2020\n23.0\n\u00a0\n557\n\u00a0\n575\n\u00a0\n6.125\n%\nApril 15, 2025\nFixed-Rate Reset:\nSeries G\nSeptember 14, 2022\n6.0\n\u00a0\n145\n\u00a0\n150\n\u00a0\n7.750\n%\nOctober 15, 2027\nTotal\n67.5\n\u00a0\n$\n1,634\n\u00a0\n$\n1,688\n\u00a0\n________________________________\n1.\nThe depositary shares underlying our preferred stock accrue dividends at an initial annual fixed rate of the $25.00 liquidation preference per depositary share from the issuance date up to, but not including, the fixed-to-floating rate or fixed-rate-reset conversion date; thereafter, dividends will accrue on a floating rate or fixed-rate-reset basis equal to the conversion rate plus a fixed spread.\n2.\nThe Series C per annum dividend rate represents the dividend rate in effect as of December 31, 2023.\n3.\nThe Series C dividend accrues at a rate equal to the 3-Month CME Term SOFR plus 0.26161%, plus a spread of \n5.111\n%, per annum, resetting quarterly in accordance with the certificate of designations for such series and the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021 (the \u201cLIBOR Act\u201d).

We also granted PSU awards to employees which generally vest at the end of a three-year \n76\nperiod provided that specified performance criteria are met. The performance criteria are based on a formula tied to our achievement of long-term economic returns consisting of the change in tangible net book value and dividends paid per common share on an absolute basis and relative to a select group of our peers. The fair value of the PSU awards granted during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 as of the grant date was $\n10\n million, $\n11\n million and $\n10\n million, respectively, assuming the target levels of performance are achieved. The actual value of the awards will vary within a range of 0% to 200% of the target based on the actual performance achieved relative to the targets.\nOur 2016 Equity Plan, as amended, authorizes a total of \n40\n million shares of our common stock that may be used to satisfy awards granted under the Plan, subject to the share counting rules set forth within the Plan. As of December\u00a031, 2023, \n28.7\n million shares remained available for awards under the 2016 Equity Plan. For purposes of determining the total number of shares available for awards under the 2016 Equity Plan, available shares are reduced by (i) shares issued for vested awards, net of units withheld to cover minimum statutory tax withholding requirements paid by us in cash on behalf of the employee, (ii) outstanding unvested awards, (iii) outstanding previously vested awards, if distribution of such awards has been deferred beyond the vesting date (\"deferred awards\"), and (iv) accrued dividend equivalent units on outstanding awards through December\u00a031, 2023. Unvested PSU awards assume the maximum potential payout under the terms of the award. As of December\u00a031, 2023, \n1.7\n million of deferred awards, including accrued dividend equivalents, were outstanding.\nDuring fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized total compensation expense of $\n15.0\n million, $\n11.6\n million and $\n21.4\n million, respectively, for stock-based awards to employees, and we recognized other operating expense of $\n1.1\n million, $\n1.0\n million and $\n0.8\n million, respectively, for stock-based awards to independent directors. Compensation expense for PSU awards is based on our estimate of the probability that the performance criteria for PSU awards will be achieved and, if applicable, includes a cumulative effect adjustment for changes in our estimate from the prior year period. As of December\u00a031, 2023, we estimate that \n66.4\n% of target for PSU awards granted in fiscal year 2021 will vest based on actual performance achieved through the end of the performance measurement period and that \n50\n% and \n100\n% of target will vest for PSU awards granted in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, respectively, based on our estimate of the probability that the performance criteria for these awards will be achieved.
