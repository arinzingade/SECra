(SBC), was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.\u2019s (ATTC) local telephone companies. On January 1, 1984, we were spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly traded telecommunications services provider. \nFollowing our formation, we expanded our communications footprint and operations, most significantly:\n\u2022\nOur subsidiaries merged with incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) Pacific Telesis Group in 1997 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999.\n\u2022\nIn 2005, we merged one of our subsidiaries with ATTC, creating one of the world\u2019s leading telecommunications providers. In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from \u201cSBC Communications Inc.\u201d to \u201cAT&T Inc.\u201d\n\u2022\nIn 2006, we acquired ILEC BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth), which included BellSouth\u2019s 40 percent economic interest in AT&T Mobility LLC (AT&T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, resulting in 100 percent ownership of AT&T Mobility.\n\u2022\nIn 2014, we completed the acquisition of wireless provider Leap Wireless International, Inc. \n\u2022\nIn 2015, we acquired wireless properties in Mexico and acquired DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States (included in our Video business) and Latin America (referred to as Vrio).\n\u2022\nFrom 2018 through April 2022, we acquired and held various investments in entertainment businesses, namely Time Warner Inc., which comprised a substantial portion of our previous WarnerMedia segment.\n\u2022\nIn July 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction (DIRECTV Transaction), we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method.\n\u2022\nIn April 2022, we completed the separation of our WarnerMedia business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction (WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction). Upon its separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations, as did other dispositions that were part of a single plan, including Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic). These businesses are reflected in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia separation.\n1\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nGeneral\nWe are a leading provider of telecommunications and technology services globally. The services and products that we offer vary by market and utilize various technology platforms in a range of geographies. Our reportable segments are organized as follows:\nThe \nCommunications segment \nprovides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect integrated product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:\n\u2022\nMobility \nprovides nationwide wireless service and equipment.\n\u2022\nBusiness Wireline \nprovides advanced ethernet-based fiber services, IP Voice and managed professional services, as well as traditional voice and data services and related equipment to business customers.\n\u2022\nConsumer Wireline \nprovides broadband services, including fiber connections that provide multi-gig services to residential customers in select locations and our fixed wireless access product that provides home internet services delivered over our 5G wireless network where available. Consumer Wireline also provides legacy telephony voice communication services.\nThe \nLatin America segment \nprovides wireless services and equipment in Mexico. \nCorporate support costs, including administrative support costs borne by AT&T where business units do not influence decision making, divested businesses and results from business no longer integral to our operations are reported as \nCorporate \nand\n Other\n, which\n \nreconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes. \nAreas of Focus\nWe are a leader in providing connectivity services through our market focus areas of 5G and fiber. Fiber underpins the connectivity we deliver, both wired and wireless. Building on that fiber foundation is our solid spectrum portfolio, strengthened through Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction acquisitions and 5G deployment. We believe our fixed wireline and mobile approach will differentiate our services and provide us with additional convergence growth opportunities in the future as bandwidth demands continue to grow. We will continue to demonstrate our commitment to ensure management attention is sharply focused on growth areas and operational efficiencies.\nOur integrated telecommunications network utilizes different technological platforms to provide instant connectivity at the higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements. Streaming, augmented reality, \u201csmart\u201d technologies and user generated content are expected to continue to drive greater demand for broadband and capitalize on our fiber and 5G deployments. During 2024, we plan to continue to develop and provide high-value, integrated mobile and broadband solutions.\nIn December 2023, we announced plans to collaborate with Ericsson to lead the U.S. in commercial scale open radio access network (Open RAN) deployment to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers, fostering lower network costs, improved operational efficiencies and allowing for continued investment in our fast-growing broadband network. We plan for about 70% of our wireless network traffic to flow across open-capable platforms by late 2026, and to have fully-integrated Open RAN sites operating starting in 2024. Beginning in 2025, we expect to scale this Open RAN environment throughout our wireless network in coordination with multiple suppliers. \nWe believe the move to an open, agile, programmable wireless network positions us to quickly capitalize on the next generation of wireless technology and spectrum when it becomes available. These innovative technologies are expected to enable lower-power, sustainable networks with higher performance to deliver enhanced user experiences.\nWireless Service \nWe continue to experience rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices, and businesses and municipalities are connecting more and more equipment and facilities to the internet. The deployment of 5G, which allows for faster connectivity, lower latency and greater bandwidth, requires modifications of existing cell sites to add equipment supporting new frequencies, like the C-Band and the 3.45 GHz band. The increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with 5G technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services. As the wireless industry has matured, with nearly full penetration of smartphones in the U.S. population, future wireless growth will depend on our ability to offer innovative services, plans and devices that bundle product offerings and take advantage of our 5G wireless network. \nTo support higher mobile data usage, our priority is to best utilize a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations on as broad a geogra\nphic basis as possible. \nWe expect to continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity, as well as obtaining additional spectrum that meets our long-term needs. We participate in FCC spectrum auctions and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support more advanced mobile internet services.\n2\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nIn North America, our network covers over 438 million people with 4G LTE and over 302 million with 5G technology. In the United States, our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 334 million people with our LTE technology and more than 302 million people with our 5G technology. \nBroadband Technology \nIn 2020, we identified fiber as a core priority for our business and enhanced our focus to expand our fiber footprint and grow customers. At December 31, 2023, we had more than 8.3 million fiber consumer wireline broadband customers, adding 1.1 million during the year. The expansion builds on our recent investments to convert to a software-based network, managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology. Software-based technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This network approach delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of next-generation technology over the traditional, hardware-intensive network approach. Our virtualized network supports next-generation applications like 5G and broadband-based services quickly and efficiently.\nBUSINESS OPERATIONS\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nOur segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.\nAdditional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading \u201cSegment Results\u201d in Item 7. and in Note 4 of Item 8.\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nOur Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our Communications services and products are marketed under the AT&T, AT&T Business, Cricket, AT&T PREPAID\nSM\n and AT&T Fiber brand names. The Communications segment provided approximately 97% of 2023 segment operating revenues and accounted for all of our 2023 total segment income. This segment contains the Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units.\nMobility \u2013 \nOur Mobility business unit provides nationwide wireless services to consumers and wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United States by utilizing our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet over wireless devices. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid, connected device or reseller. As of December\u00a031, 2023, we served 242 million Mobility subscribers, including 87 million postpaid (71 million phone), 19 million prepaid, 7 million reseller and 128 million connected devices. Our Mobility business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\nServices\nWe offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans to meet the communications needs of targeted customer categories. Through FirstNet\n\u00ae\n services, we also provide a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety.\nConsumers continue to require increasing availability of data-centric services and a network to connect and control those devices. An increasing number of our subscribers are using more advanced devices, including embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT). We offer unlimited plans that include features allowing for the sharing of voice, text and data across multiple devices, which attracts subscribers from other providers and helps minimize subscriber churn. Customers in our \u201cconnected device\u201d category (e.g., users of monitoring devices and automobile systems) generally purchase those devices from third-party suppliers that buy data access supported by our network. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and application developers to further capitalize on the continued growing demand for wireless data services.\nWe also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance. These services are offered under the Cricket and AT&T PREPAID brands and are typically monthly prepaid services.\nEquipment\nWe sell a wide variety of handsets, wireless data cards and wireless computing devices manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services. We also sell accessories, such as carrying cases/protective covers and wireless chargers. We sell through our own company-owned stores, agents and third-party retail stores. We provide our customers the ability to purchase handsets on an installment basis and the opportunity to bring their own device. Subscribers that bring their own devices or retain handsets for longer periods impact upgrade activity. Like other wireless service providers, we also provide postpaid contract subscribers promotional equipment offers to initiate, renew or upgrade service.\n3\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nBusiness Wireline \u2013 \nOur Business Wireline business unit provides services to business customers, including multinational corporations, small and mid-sized businesses, governmental and wholesale customers. Our Business Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\nServices\nWe offer advanced IP-based services, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPN), AT&T Dedicated Internet, and Ethernet as well as traditional data services, cloud solutions, outsourcing and managed professional services. We provide collaboration services that utilize our IP infrastructure and allow our customers to utilize the most advanced technology to improve their productivity. \nWe continue to reconfigure our wireline network to take advantage of the latest technologies and services, and rely on our SDN and NFV to enhance business customers\u2019 digital agility in a rapidly evolving environment. Some of the services we have offered historically are in secular decline and, going forward, we will focus on our owned and operated connectivity services powered by 5G and fiber.\nEquipment\nEquipment revenues include customer premises equipment.\nConsumer Wireline\n \u2013 Our Consumer Wireline business unit provides broadband services, including fiber connections, and legacy telephony voice communication services to customers in the United States by utilizing our IP-based and copper wired network. Additionally, this business unit offers AT&T Internet Air, which is a fixed wireless access product that provides home internet services delivered over our 5G wireless network where available. Our Consumer Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: broadband, legacy voice and data services and other service and equipment.\nBroadband Services\nWe provide broadband and internet services to approximately 15 million customer locations, with 8 million fiber broadband connections at December\u00a031, 2023. With changes in video viewing preferences and the impacts of remote work and learning trends, we are experiencing increasing demand for high-speed broadband services. We believe our investment in expanding our industry-leading fiber network positions us to be a leader in wired connectivity. With our focus on fiber that brings efficiencies and owner economics, we continue to evaluate opportunities where we can turn down existing copper infrastructure. \nWe believe that our flexible platform with a broadband and wireless connection is the most efficient way to transport direct-to-consumer video and data experiences both at home and on mobile devices. Through this integrated approach, we can optimize the use of storage in the home as well as in the cloud, while also providing a seamless service for consumers across screens and locations. \nLegacy Voice and Data Services\nRevenues from our traditional voice services continue to decline as customers switch to wireless or VoIP services provided by us, cable companies or other internet-based providers.\nOther Services and Equipment\nOther service revenues include VoIP services, customer fees and equipment.\nAdditional information on our Communications segment is contained in the \u201cOverview\u201d section of Item 7.\nLATIN AMERICA\nOur Latin America segment provides wireless services in Mexico. We utilize our regional and national wireless networks in Mexico to provide consumer and business customers with wireless data and voice communication services. We divide our revenue into the following categories: service and equipment.\nServices\nWe provide postpaid and prepaid wireless services in Mexico to approximately 22 million subscribers under the AT&T and Unefon brands.

We also offer prepaid services to customers who prefer to pay in advance.\nEquipment\nWe sell a wide variety of handsets, including smartphones manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services. We sell through our own company-owned stores, agents and third-party retail stores.\nAdditional information on our Latin America segment is contained in the \u201cOverview\u201d section of Item 7.\n4\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nMAJOR CLASSES OF SERVICE\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total consolidated reported operating revenues by any class of service that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated total operating revenues in any of the last three fiscal years:\nPercentage of Total \nConsolidated Operating Revenues\n2023\n2022\n2021\nCommunications Segment\nWireless service\n52\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n50\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n43\u00a0\n\u00a0%\nBusiness service\n17\n\u00a0\n18\u00a0\n17\u00a0\nEquipment\n17\n\u00a0\n18\u00a0\n16\u00a0\nLatin America Segment\nWireless service\n2\n\u00a0\n2\u00a0\n1\u00a0\nEquipment\n1\n\u00a0\n1\u00a0\n1\u00a0\nCorporate and Other\nVideo services\n1\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n12\u00a0\n1\nU.S. video operations were separated in July 2021. (See Note 6)\nAdditional information on our geographical distribution of revenues is contained in Note 4 of Item 8.\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nFacilities-based wireless communications providers in the United States, like AT&T, must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with FCC rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum. The FCC\u2019s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high-quality, innovative services our customers demand. Wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period, typically 10 to 15 years, and we must seek renewal of these licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Additionally, while wireless communications providers\u2019 prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation, the federal government and various states periodically consider new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services.\nThe Communications Act of 1934 and other related laws give the FCC broad authority to regulate the U.S. operations of our interstate telecommunications services. In addition, our ILEC subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments, which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services, provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law. Some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings. These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers.\nWe continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts at both the federal and state levels to minimize and/or moderate regulatory burdens that are no longer appropriate in a competitive communications market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer services wanted and needed by our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition.\nOur subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided.\nFor a discussion of significant regulatory issues directly affecting our operations, please see the information contained under the headings \u201cOperating Environment Overview\u201d and \u201cRegulatory Landscape\u201d of Item 7, which information is incorporated herein by reference. \nIMPORTANCE, DURATION AND EFFECT OF LICENSES\nCertain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct business. Many of our subsidiaries also hold government-issued licenses or franchises to provide wireline or wireless services. Additional information relating to regulations affecting those rights is contained under the heading \n5\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\n\u201cOperating Environment Overview,\u201d of Item 7. We actively pursue patents, trademarks, and service marks to protect our intellectual property within the United States and abroad. We maintain a significant global portfolio of patents, trademarks, and service mark registrations. We have also entered into licenses that permit other companies to utilize certain of our patents, trademarks, service marks, and technologies, in exchange for payments and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions. As we transition our network from a switch-based network to an IP, software-based network, we have increasingly entered into licensing agreements with software developers.\nWe periodically license third-party patents and other intellectual rights in exchange for payments. We also receive claims from third parties asserting that our products, services, or technologies infringe on their patents or other intellectual property rights. These claims could require us to pay damages or acquire license rights, stop offering the relevant products or services, and/or cease network functions or other activities. While the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement claims or the expiration or non-renewal of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nMAJOR CUSTOMERS\nNo customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nCOMPETITION\nCompetition continues to increase for communications and digital services from traditional and nontraditional competitors. Technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available. In addition, lack of or a reduced level of regulation of comparable legacy services has lowered costs for alternative communications service providers. As a result, we face continuing competition as well as some new opportunities in significant portions of our business.\nWireless \nWe face substantial competition in our wireless businesses. Under current FCC rules, multiple licensees, who provide wireless services on the cellular, PCS, Advanced Wireless Services, 700 MHz and other spectrum bands, may operate in each of our U.S. service areas. Our competitors include two national wireless providers; a larger number of regional providers and resellers of each of those providers\u2019 services; and certain cable companies. In addition, we face competition from providers who offer voice, text messaging and other services as applications on data networks. We are one of three facilities-based providers in Mexico (retail and wholesale), with the most significant market share controlled by Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil. We may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other communications technologies and services. While some of these technologies and services are now operational, others are being developed or may be developed. We compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network quality, coverage area and customer service.\nBroadband \nThe desire for high-speed data on demand, including video, is continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional wired or linear services and use our fiber services or competitors\u2019 wireless, satellite and internet-based services. In most U.S. markets, we compete for customers with large cable companies and wireless broadband providers for high-speed internet and voice services.\nLegacy Voice and Data \nWe continue to lose legacy voice and data subscribers due to competitors (e.g., wireless, cable and VoIP providers) who can provide comparable services at lower prices because they are not subject to traditional telephone industry regulation (or the extent of regulation they are subject to is in dispute), utilize different technologies or promote a different business model (such as advertising-based). In most U.S. markets, we compete for customers with large cable companies and other smaller telecommunications companies for both long-distance and local services.\nAdditionally, we provide local and interstate telephone and switched services to other service providers, primarily large internet service providers using the largest class of nationwide internet networks (internet backbone), wireless carriers, other telephone companies, cable companies and systems integrators. These services are subject to additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies, the introduction of innovative offerings and increasing satellite, wireless, fiber-optic and cable transmission capacity for services.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nAT&T scientists and engineers conduct research in a variety of areas, including IP networking, advanced network design and architecture, network and cybersecurity, network operations support systems and data analytics. The majority of the development activities are performed to create new services and to invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers. Research and development expenses were $954 in 2023, $1,236 in 2022, and $1,325 in 2021.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nNumber of Employees\n As of January 31, 2024, we employed approximately 149,900 persons.\n6\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nEmployee Development\n We believe our success depends on our employees\u2019 success and that all employees must have the skills they need to thrive. We offer training and elective courses that give employees the opportunity to enhance their skills. We also intend to help cultivate the next generation of talent that will lead our company into the future by providing employees with educational opportunities through our internal training organization.\nLabor Contracts\n Approximately 42% of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) or other unions. After expiration of the collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached. The main contracts set to expire in 2024 include the following: a contract covering approximately 5,000 Mobility employees in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas is set to expire in February; a wireline contract covering approximately 8,500 employees in California and Nevada is set to expire in April; and three wireline contracts covering approximately 15,000 employees in the southeastern United States are set to expire in August.\nCompensation and Benefits\n In addition to salaries, we provide a variety of benefit programs to help meet the needs of our employees. These programs cover active and former employees and may vary by subsidiary and region. These programs include 401(k) plans, pension benefits, and health and welfare benefits, among many others. In addition to our active employee base, at December\u00a031, 2023, we had approximately 505,000 retirees and dependents who were eligible to receive retiree benefits.\nWe review our benefit plans to maintain competitive packages that reflect the needs of our workforce. We also adapt our compensation model to provide fair and inclusive pay practices across our business. We are committed to pay equity for employees who hold the same jobs, work in the same geographic area, and have the same levels of experience and performance.\nEmployee Wellness\n We provide our employees access to flexible and convenient health and welfare programs and workplace accommodations. We have prioritized self-care and emphasized a focus on wellness, providing flexible scheduling or time-off options and implementing technologies to enhance the remote work environment.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n We believe that championing diversity and fostering inclusion does more than just make us a better company, it contributes to a world where people are empowered to be their very best. That is why we are committed to equality and one of the reasons why our company purpose is to connect people to greater possibilities. This focus on diversity emanates from our diverse and inclusive workforce, which is a product of our unwavering commitment to ensure that employees from any and every segment of society are treated with fairness and provided equal opportunities to advance in the company.\nTo have a diverse and inclusive workforce, we have put an emphasis on attracting and hiring talented people who represent a mix of backgrounds, identities and experiences. Across the AT&T family of companies, we have employee groups that reflect our diverse workforce. These groups are not only organized around women, people of color, faith, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities and veterans, but also around professionals who are experienced or interested in cybersecurity, engineering, innovation and project management. We believe that when everyone\u2019s unique story is celebrated, we are able to connect, create and innovate in real and meaningful ways. It is important that our employees feel valued, have a sense of belonging and are fully engaged in our success.",
    "item1a": ">ITEM 1A.\n RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this document, including the matters contained under the caption \u201cCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d you should carefully read the matters described below. We believe that each of these matters could materially affect our business. Most, if not all, of these factors are beyond our ability to control.\nMacro-Economic Factors:\nAdverse changes in the U.S. securities markets, increasing interest rates, rising inflation and medical costs could materially increase our benefit plan costs and future funding requirements. \nOur costs to provide current benefits and funding for future benefits are subject to increases, primarily due to continuing increases in medical and prescription drug costs, in part due to inflation, and can be affected by lower returns on assets held by our pension and other benefit plans, which are reflected in our financial statements for that year. In calculating the recognized benefit costs, we have made certain assumptions regarding future investment returns, interest rates and medical costs. These assumptions could change significantly over time and could be materially different than originally projected. Lower than assumed investment returns, an increase in our benefit obligations, and higher than assumed medical and prescription drug costs will increase expenses.\n7\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) requires companies to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an asset or liability in their statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur. We have elected to reflect the annual adjustments to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income. Therefore, an increase in our costs or adverse market conditions will have a negative effect on our operating results.\nSignificant adverse changes in capital markets could result in the deterioration of our defined benefit plans\u2019 funded status. \nInflationary pressures on costs, such as inputs for devices we sell and network components, labor and distribution costs may impact our network construction, our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a provider of telecommunications and technology services, we sell handsets, wireless data cards, wireless computing devices and customer premises equipment manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services and depend on suppliers to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with items such as network equipment, customer premises equipment, and wireless-related equipment such as mobile hotspots, handsets, wirelessly enabled computers, wireless data cards and other connected devices for our customers. Beginning in 2021 and continuing through the early part of 2024, the costs of these inputs and the costs of labor necessary to develop, deploy and maintain our networks and our products and services increased. In addition, many of these inputs are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, demand for raw materials used in the production of these devices and network components, weather, climate change, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, governmental actions, import and export requirements (including tariffs), and other factors beyond our control. Inflationary and supply pressures may continue into the future and could have an adverse impact on our ability to source materials.\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products and services, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchases altogether, during a period of inflationary pressure or an economic downturn. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset any cost increases through productivity and cost-saving initiatives.\nAdverse changes in global financial markets could limit our ability and our larger customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operations.\nDuring 2023, uncertainty surrounding global growth rates, inflation, and an increasing interest rate environment continued to produce volatility in the credit, currency and equity markets. Volatility may affect companies\u2019 access to the credit markets, leading to higher borrowing costs, or, in some cases, the inability to fund ongoing operations. In addition, we contract with large financial institutions to support our own treasury operations, including contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rates and foreign exchange and the funding of credit lines and other short-term debt obligations, including commercial paper. These financial institutions face stricter capital-related and other regulations in the United States and Europe, as well as ongoing legal and financial issues concerning their loan portfolios, which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit.\nA company\u2019s cost of borrowing is affected by evaluations given by various credit rating agencies and these agencies have been applying tighter credit standards when evaluating debt levels and future growth prospects. While we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income markets when needed, adverse changes in the financial markets could render us either unable to access these markets or able to access these markets only at higher interest costs and with restrictive financial or other conditions, severely affecting our business operations. Additionally, downgrades of our credit rating by the major credit rating agencies could increase our cost of borrowing and also impact the collateral we would be required to post under certain agreements we have entered into with our derivative counterparties, which could negatively impact our liquidity. Further, valuation changes in our derivative portfolio due to interest rates and foreign exchange rates could require us to post collateral and thus may negatively impact our liquidity.\nOur international operations increase our exposure to political instability, to changes in the international economy and to regulation on our business and these risks could offset our expected growth opportunities.\nWe have international operations, particularly in Mexico, and other countries worldwide where we need to comply with a wide variety of complex local laws, regulations and treaties. In addition, we are exposed to, among other factors, fluctuations in currency values, changes in relationships between U.S. and foreign governments, war or other hostilities, and other regulations that may materially affect our earnings. Involvement with foreign firms also exposes us to the risk of being unable to control the \n8\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nactions of those firms and therefore exposes us to risks associated with our obligation to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Violations of the FCPA could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIndustry-Wide Factors:\nChanges to federal, state and foreign government regulations and decisions in regulatory proceedings, as well as private litigation, could further increase our operating costs and/or alter customer perceptions of our operations, which could materially adversely affect us.\nOur subsidiaries providing wired services are subject to significant federal and state regulation while many of our competitors are not. In addition, our subsidiaries and affiliates operating outside the United States are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided. Our wireless subsidiaries are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC and in some instances, by state and local agencies. Adverse regulations and rulings by the FCC relating to broadband and wireless deployment, including the proposed rules regarding net neutrality, could impede our ability to manage our networks and recover costs and lessen incentives to invest in our networks. The continuing growth of IP-based services, especially when accessed by wireless devices, has created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the FCC and various state and local authorities, which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcomes unfavorable to us. In addition, in response to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) questioning whether cell sites transmitting C-band spectrum could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplanes, we voluntarily committed to temporary, precautionary measures near certain airports through January 1, 2028, which may have limited impacts to deployments and services. In addition, increased public focus on a variety of issues related to our operations, such as privacy issues, government requests or orders for customer data, and concerns about global climate changes, have led to proposals or new legislation at state, federal and foreign government levels to change or increase regulation on our operations. Enactment of new privacy laws and regulations could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to collect data and offer targeted advertisements or result in additional costs of compliance or litigation. Should customers decide that our competitors offer a more customer-friendly environment, our competitive position, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nEffects of climate change may impose risk of damage to our infrastructure, our ability to provide services, and may cause changes in federal, state and foreign government regulation, all of which may result in potential adverse impact to our financial results.\nExtreme weather events precipitated by long-term climate change have the potential to directly damage network facilities or disrupt our ability to build and maintain portions of our network and could potentially disrupt suppliers\u2019 ability to provide products and services required to provide reliable network coverage. Any such disruption could delay network deployment plans, interrupt service for our customers, increase our costs and have a negative effect on our operating results. The potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires, freezing conditions, sea-level rise and other climate-related events, could adversely affect our operations, infrastructure and financial results. Operational impacts resulting from the potential physical effects of climate change, such as damage to our network infrastructure, could result in increased costs and loss of revenue. We could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate such physical effects of climate change. While we currently do not believe the potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change will be material, it is difficult to accurately and precisely calculate the future impacts of the physical effects of climate change given the dynamic nature of climate change\u2019s impacts on the environment.  \nFurther, customers, consumers, investors, governments and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste and other sustainability concerns. Concern over climate change or other environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment and reduce the impact of our business on climate change. Further, climate change regulations may require us to alter our proposed business plans or increase our operating costs due to increased regulation or environmental considerations, and could adversely affect our business and reputation. \nContinuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless and broadband services will require us to deploy significant amounts of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive services to customers.\nWireless and broadband services are undergoing rapid and significant technological changes and a dramatic increase in usage, including, in particular, the demand for faster and seamless usage of data, including video, across mobile and fixed devices. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these changes and also resulted in higher network utilization, as more customers consume bandwidth from changes in work and learn from home trends. We must continually invest in our networks in order to improve our wireless and broadband services to meet this increasing demand and changes in customer expectations while remaining competitive. Improvements in these services depend on many factors, including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these services. In order to stem \n9\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nbroadband subscriber losses to cable competitors in our non-fiber wireline areas, we have been expanding our all-fiber wireline network. We must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of data, including video, and voice between cell and fixed landline sites. To this end, we participate in spectrum auctions and continue to deploy software and other technology advancements in order to efficiently invest in our network.\nWe have spent, and plan to continue spending, significant capital and other resources on the ongoing development and deployment of our 5G and fiber wireline networks.\n \nThis deployment and other network service enhancements and product launches may not occur as scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factors, including unexpected inflation, delays in determining equipment and wireless handset operating standards, supplier delays, software issues, increases in network and handset component costs, regulatory permitting delays for tower sites or enhancements, or labor-related delays. Deployment of new technology also may adversely affect the performance of the network for existing services. If we cannot acquire needed spectrum, our 5G and fiber offerings fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or we otherwise fail to deploy the services customers desire on a timely basis with acceptable quality and at reasonable costs, then our ability to attract and retain customers, and, therefore, maintain and improve our operating margins, could be materially adversely affected.\nIncreasing competition for wireless customers could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have multiple wireless competitors in each of our service areas and compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network quality, coverage area and customer service. In addition, we are facing growing competition from providers offering services using advanced wireless technologies and IP-based networks. We expect market saturation to continue which may cause the wireless industry\u2019s customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rates, leading to increased competition for customers. Our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or promotional strategies pursued by competitors. We also expect that our customers\u2019 growing demand for high-speed video and data services will place constraints on our network capacity. These competition and capacity constraints will continue to put pressure on pricing and margins as companies compete for potential customers. Additionally, we may not be able to accurately predict future consumer demands or the success of new services in markets.\n \nOur ability to address these issues will depend, among other things, on continued improvement in network quality and customer service and our ability to price our products and services competitively as well as effective marketing of attractive products and services. These efforts will involve significant expenses and require strategic management decisions on, and timely implementation of, equipment choices, network deployment and service offerings.\nIntellectual property rights may be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunities, which may materially adversely affect our operations. \nWe may need to spend significant amounts of money to protect our intellectual property rights. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, could materially adversely impact our operations.\nIncidents or public assertions leading to damage to our reputation or questions about our business conduct, and any resulting lawsuits, claims or other legal proceedings, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that our brand image, awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumers and contribute significantly to the success of our business.\n \nOur ability to attract and retain employees is highly dependent upon our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workplace, ethical business practices and other qualities. Acts of misconduct by any employee, and particularly by senior management, could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation. Negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny or litigation could result from actual or alleged conduct by us or those currently or formerly associated with us, and from any number of activities or circumstances, including operations, employment-related offenses (such as sexual harassment and discrimination), regulatory compliance and actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct. \nWe currently are, and may in the future be, named as a defendant in lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business based on alleged acts of misconduct by employees. These actions seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury (including claims for loss of life), workers\u2019 compensation, employment discrimination, sexual harassment, workplace misconduct, wage and hour claims and other employment-related damages, compensation for breach of contract, statutory or regulatory claims, negligence or gross negligence, punitive damages, consequential damages, and civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief. The outcome of any allegations, lawsuits, claims or legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and could result in significant costs, damage to our brands or reputation and diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business. In 2023, \nThe\n \nWall Street Journal\n published a series of articles alleging that lead-clad telecommunications cables are a public-health hazard or may pose environmental risks. We are currently subject to litigation and have received inquiries from government authorities as a result of these assertions.\n \nWe may be subject to additional litigation, government investigations and potentially new regulation or legislation relating to lead-clad cables. Any damage to our reputation or payments of significant amounts as a result of any of these issues, even if reserved, could materially and adversely affect our business, ability to serve customers, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \n10\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nOur business is subject to risks related to public health crises.\nPublic health crises and resulting mitigation measures have in the past, and may in the future, cause a negative effect on our operating results. These effects include, but are not limited to, closure of retail stores; impact on our customers\u2019 ability to pay for our products and services; reduction in international roaming revenue; and reduced staffing levels in call centers and field operations. We also have in the past, and may in the future, incur significantly higher expenses attributable to infrastructure investments and increased labor costs.\n \nCompany-Specific Financial Factors:\nCustomer adoption of new software-based technologies may require higher quality services from us, and meeting these demands could create supply chain issues and could increase capital costs. \nThe communications industry has experienced rapid changes in the past several years. An increasing number of our customers are using mobile devices as their primary means of viewing video. In addition, businesses and government bodies are broadly shifting to wireless-based services for homes and infrastructure to improve services to their respective customers and constituencies. We have spent, and continue to spend, significant capital to shift our wired network to software-based technology and are expanding 5G wireless technology to address these demands. We are entering into a significant number of software licensing agreements and working with software developers to provide network functions in lieu of installing switches or other physical network equipment in order to respond to rapid developments in wireless demand. While software-based functionality can be changed much more quickly than, for example, physical switches, the rapid pace of development means that we may increasingly need to rely on single-source and software solutions that have not previously been deployed in production environments. Should this software not function as intended or our license agreements provide inadequate protection from intellectual property infringement claims, we could be forced to either substitute (if available) or else spend time to develop alternative technologies at a much higher cost and incur harm to our reputation for reliability, and, as a result, our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected.\nWe depend on various suppliers to provide equipment to operate our business and satisfy customer demand and interruption or delay in supply can adversely impact our operating results.\nWe depend on suppliers to provide us, directly or through other suppliers, with items such as network equipment, customer premises equipment and wireless-related equipment such as mobile hotspots, handsets, wirelessly enabled computers, wireless data cards and other connected devices for our customers. In some instances, we depend on key single-source suppliers to provide important inputs where there are few alternative suppliers available.\n \nThese suppliers could fail to provide equipment on a timely or cost effective basis, or fail to meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technologies, inflationary pressures, inability to secure component parts, general business disruption, natural disasters, safety issues, economic and political instability, including the outbreak of war and other hostilities, and public health emergencies. These factors have caused, and may again cause, delays in the development, manufacturing (including the sourcing of key components) and shipment of products to the extent that we or our suppliers are impacted. In certain limited circumstances, suppliers have been unable to supply products in a timely fashion, affecting our ability to provide products and services precisely as and when requested by our customers. It is possible that, in some circumstances, we could be forced to switch to a different key supplier or be unable to meet customer demand for certain products or services. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products of one or more key suppliers with products from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase our costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a negative effect on our operating results. \nIncreasing costs to provide services and failure to renew agreements on favorable terms, or at all, could adversely affect operating margins.\nOur operating costs, including customer acquisition and retention costs, could continue to put pressure on margins and customer retention levels. \nA number of our competitors offering comparable legacy services that rely on alternative technologies and business models are typically subject to less regulation, and therefore are able to operate with lower costs. These competitors generally can focus on discrete customer segments since they do not have regulatory obligations to provide universal service. Also, these competitors have cost advantages compared to us, due in part to operating on newer, more technically advanced and lower-cost networks with a nonunionized workforce, lower employee benefits and fewer retirees. We are transitioning services from our copper-based network and seeking regulatory approvals, where needed, at both the state and federal levels. If we do not obtain regulatory approvals for our network transition or obtain approvals with onerous conditions, we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantages.\n11\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nWe may not realize or sustain the expected benefits from our business transformation initiatives and these efforts could have a materially adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, results of operations and competitive position.\nWe have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiatives, including the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction, which are designed to reduce costs, enable legacy rationalization, streamline and modernize distribution and customer service, remove redundancies and simplify and improve processes and support functions. Our focus is on supporting added customer value with an improved customer experience. We intend for these efficiencies to enable increased investments in our strategic areas of focus, which consist of improving broadband connectivity (for example, fiber and 5G). We also expect these initiatives to drive efficiencies and improved margins. If we do not successfully manage and execute these initiatives, or if they are inadequate or ineffective, we may fail to meet our financial goals and achieve anticipated benefits, improvements may be delayed, not sustained or not realized, and our business, operations and competitive position could be adversely affected. Further, we intend to use artificial intelligence (AI)-driven efficiencies in our network design, software development and customer support services.\n \nThe models used in those products, particularly generative AI models, may produce output or take action that is incorrect, release private or confidential information, reflect biases included in the data on which they are trained, infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, or be otherwise harmful.\n \nAny of these risks could expose us to liability or adverse legal or regulatory consequences and harm our reputation and the public perception of our business or the effectiveness of our security measures.\nUnfavorable litigation or governmental investigation results could require us to pay significant amounts or lead to onerous operating procedures.\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits both in the United States and in foreign countries, including, at any particular time, claims relating to antitrust, patent infringement, wage and hour, personal injury, environmental, customer privacy violations, cyberattacks, regulatory proceedings, breach of contract, and selling and collection practices. We also spend substantial resources complying with various government standards, which may entail related investigations and litigation. In the wireless and wireline area, we also face current and potential litigation relating to alleged adverse health effects on customers or employees who use such technologies including, for example, wireless devices. We may incur significant expenses defending such suits or government charges and may be required to pay amounts or otherwise change our operations in ways that could materially adversely affect our operations or financial results.\nCyberattacks impacting our networks or systems may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nCyberattacks\n \n\u2013 including through the use of malware, computer viruses, distributed denial of services attacks, ransomware attacks, credential harvesting, social engineering and other means for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our networks and systems and those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers\n \n\u2013 could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\n \nCyberattacks can cause equipment or network failures, loss of information, including sensitive personal information of customers or employees or proprietary information, as well as disruptions to our or our customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 operations, which could result in significant expenses, potential investigations and legal liability, a loss of current or future customers and reputational damage. As our networks evolve, they are becoming increasingly reliant on software to handle growing demands for data consumption. Cyberattacks against companies, including the Company and its suppliers and vendors, have occurred and will continue to occur and have increased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. Further, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our suppliers, vendors and other service providers.\n \nAdditionally, as cyberattacks become increasingly sophisticated, a post-attack investigation may not be able to ascertain the entire scope of the attack\u2019s impact.\n \nExtensive and costly efforts are undertaken to develop and test systems before deployment and to conduct ongoing monitoring and updating to prevent and withstand such attacks. While, to date, we have not been subject to cyberattacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we take to reduce the risks associated with cyberattacks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effects of a major cyberattack in the future.\nNatural disasters, extreme weather conditions or terrorist or other hostile acts could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations.\nOur business operations could be subject to interruption by equipment failures, power outages, terrorist or other hostile acts, including acts of war, and natural disasters, such as flooding, hurricanes and forest fires, whether caused by discrete severe weather events and/or precipitated by long-term climate change. Such events could cause significant damage to the infrastructure upon which our business operations rely, resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customers, as well as significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. Our system redundancy and other measures we take to protect our infrastructure and operations from the impacts of such events may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operations through all such events. Any of these occurrences could result in lost revenues from business interruption, damage to our reputation and reduced profits.\n12\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nIncreases in our debt levels to fund spectrum purchases, or other strategic decisions could adversely affect our ability to finance future debt at attractive rates and reduce our ability to respond to competition and adverse economic trends.\nWe have incurred debt to fund significant acquisitions, as well as spectrum purchases needed to compete in our industry. While we believe such decisions were prudent and necessary to take advantage of both growth opportunities and respond to industry developments, we did experience credit-rating downgrades from historical levels. Banks and potential purchasers of our publicly traded debt may decide that these strategic decisions and similar actions we may take in the future, as well as expected trends in the industry, will continue to increase the risk of investing in our debt and may demand a higher rate of interest, impose restrictive covenants or otherwise limit the amount of potential borrowing. Additionally, our capital allocation plan is focused on, among other things, managing our debt level going forward. Any failure to successfully execute this plan could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\nOur business may be impacted by changes in tax laws and regulations, judicial interpretations of the same or administrative actions by\n \nfederal, state, local and foreign taxing authorities.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In many cases, the application of existing, newly enacted or amended tax laws (such as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretations, especially when evaluated against ever-changing products and services provided by our global telecommunications and technology businesses. In addition, tax legislation has been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdictions that could significantly impact our tax rate, tax liabilities, and carrying value of deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. Any of these changes could materially impact our financial performance and our tax provision, net income and cash flows.\nWe are also subject to ongoing examinations by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. Although we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of provisions for taxes, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. In the event that we have not accurately or fully described, disclosed or determined, calculated or remitted amounts that were due to taxing authorities or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, we could be subject to additional taxes, penalties and interest, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and operating results. \nIf the distribution of WarnerMedia, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify for non-recognition treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes under audit, then we could be subject to significant tax liability.\nIn connection with the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction, AT&T received a favorable Private Letter Ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n \nNonetheless, the IRS or another applicable tax authority could determine on audit that the distribution by us of WarnerMedia to our stockholders and certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of the facts, representations or undertakings made in connection with the request for the ruling were incorrect or are violated. We may be entitled to indemnification from Warner Bros. Discovery (Warner Bros.) in the case of certain breaches of representations or undertakings by Warner Bros. under the tax matters agreement related to the WarnerMedia/Discovery Transaction. However, we could potentially be required to pay such tax prior to reimbursement from Warner Bros., and such indemnification is subject to Warner Bros.\u2019 credit risk. If the IRS or another tax authority were to so conclude, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n13\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nCAUTIONARY LANGUAGE CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nInformation set forth in this report contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially. Many of these factors are discussed in more detail in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. We claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.\nThe following factors could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements:\n\u2022\nAdverse economic and political changes, including inflation and rising interest rates, war or other hostilities, and public health emergencies, and our ability to access financial markets at favorable rates and terms.\n\u2022\nIncreases in our benefit plans\u2019 costs, including due to worse-than-assumed investment returns and discount rates, mortality assumptions, medical cost trends, or healthcare laws or regulations.\n\u2022\nThe final outcome of FCC and other federal, state or foreign government agency proceedings (including judicial review of such proceedings) and legislative and regulatory efforts involving issues important to our business, including, without limitation, pending Notices of Apparent Liability; the transition from legacy technologies to IP-based infrastructure, including the withdrawal of legacy TDM-based services; universal service; broadband deployment; wireless equipment siting regulations and, in particular, siting for 5G service; E911 services; rules concerning digital discrimination; competition policy; privacy; net neutrality; copyright protection; availability of new spectrum on fair and balanced terms; and wireless and satellite license awards and renewals, and our response to such legislative and regulatory efforts.\n\u2022\nEnactment of or changes to state, local, federal and/or foreign tax laws and regulations, and actions by tax agencies and judicial authorities that reduce our incentive to invest in our networks, and the resolution of disputes with any taxing jurisdictions, pertaining to our subsidiaries and foreign investments.\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding intellectual property rights protection and privacy, personal data protection and user consent, which are complex and rapidly evolving.\n\u2022\nOur ability to compete in an increasingly competitive industry and against competitors that can offer product/service offerings at lower prices due to lower cost structures and regulatory and legislative actions adverse to us, including non-regulation of comparable alternative technologies and/or government-owned or subsidized networks, and our response to such competition and emerging technologies.\n\u2022\nDisruption in our supply chain for a number of reasons, including, difficulties in obtaining export licenses for certain technology, inability to secure component parts, lack of suppliers, general business disruption, workforce shortage, natural disasters, safety issues, vendor fraud, economic and political instability, including disruptions in the capital markets, the outbreak of war or other hostilities, and public health emergencies.\n\u2022\nThe development and delivery of attractive and profitable wireless and broadband offerings and devices, including our ability to match speeds offered by competitors;

    "item1b": ">ITEM 1B.\n UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable.\nITEM 1C. \nCYBERSECURITY\nGovernance \nBoard and Audit Committee Oversight\nOur Board of Directors has delegated to the Audit Committee the oversight responsibility to review and discuss with management the Company\u2019s privacy and data security, including cybersecurity, risk exposures, policies and practices, and the steps management has taken to detect, monitor and control such risks and the potential impact of those exposures on our business, financial results, operations and reputation. The full Board and Audit Committee regularly receives reports and presentations on privacy and data security, which address relevant cybersecurity issues and risks and span a wide range of topics. These reports and presentations are provided by officers with responsibility for privacy and data security, who include our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and AT&T\u2019s Legal team. In addition to regular reports to the Audit Committee, we have protocols by which certain security incidents are escalated within the Company and, where appropriate, reported in a timely manner to the Audit Committee.\nChief Security Office/CISO\nWe maintain a Chief Security Office (CSO), which is charged with management-level responsibility for all aspects of network and information security within the Company. Led by our CISO and comprised of a large team of highly trained security professionals across multiple countries, the CSO is responsible for:\na.\nestablishing the policies, standards and requirements for the security of AT&T\u2019s computing and network environments;\nb.\nprotecting AT&T-owned and -managed assets and resources against unauthorized access by monitoring potential security threats, correlating network events, and overseeing the execution of corrective actions; \nc.\npromoting compliance with AT&T\u2019s security policies and network and information security program in a consistent manner on network systems and applications; and\nd.\nproviding security thought leadership in the global security arena. \nOur CISO plays the key management role in assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The CISO also works closely with AT&T Legal to oversee compliance with legal, regulatory and contractual security requirements. The CISO has extensive technical leadership experience and cybersecurity expertise, gained from approximately 20 years of experience, including serving as the Chief Information Security Officer and Director of the Office of Cybersecurity at a U.S. government agency, in addition to serving as the Chief Information Security Officer of two large public companies. Prior to that, he served for 20 years in the U.S. military, in various information technology roles of increasing seniority. The security professionals in the CSO have cybersecurity backgrounds and expertise relevant to their roles, including, in certain circumstances, relevant industry certifications. \nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe maintain a network and information security program that is reasonably designed to protect our information, and that of our customers, from unauthorized risks to their confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Our program encompasses the CSO and its policies, platforms, procedures, and processes for assessing, identifying, and managing risks from cybersecurity threats, including third-party risk from vendors and suppliers; and the program is generally designed to identify and respond to security incidents and threats in a timely manner to minimize the loss or compromise of information assets and to facilitate incident resolution.\nWe maintain continuous and near-real-time security monitoring of the AT&T network for investigation, action and response to network security events. This security monitoring leverages tools, where available, such as near-real-time data correlation, situational awareness reporting, active incident investigation, case management, trend analysis and predictive security alerting. We assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats through various mechanisms, which from time to time may include tabletop exercises to test our preparedness and incident response process, business unit assessments, control gap analyses, threat modeling, impact analyses, internal audits, external audits, penetration tests and engaging third parties to conduct analyses of our information security program. We conduct vulnerability testing and assess identified vulnerabilities for severity, the potential impact to AT&T and our customers, and likelihood of occurrence. We regularly evaluate security controls to maintain their functionality in accordance with security policy. We also obtain cybersecurity threat intelligence from recognized forums, third parties, and other sources as part of our risk assessment process. In addition, as a critical infrastructure entity, we collaborate with numerous agencies in the U.S. government to help protect U.S. communications networks and critical infrastructure, which, in turn, informs our cybersecurity threat intelligence. \n15\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nWith respect to incident response, the Company has adopted a Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan, as well as a Data Privacy Incident Response Plan that applies if customer information has been compromised (together, the \u201cIRPs\u201d), to provide a common framework for responding to security incidents. This framework establishes procedures for identifying, validating, categorizing, documenting and responding to security events that are identified by or reported to the CSO.

Upon the separation and distribution of WarnerMedia, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations. For discontinued operations, we also evaluated transactions that were components of AT&T\u2019s single plan of a strategic shift, including dispositions that did not individually meet the criteria due to materiality, and determined discontinued operations to be comprised of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic. These businesses are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction. (See Notes 6 and 24)\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction, we separated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method. (See Note 6)\nWe have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America. Our segment results presented in Note 4 and discussed below follow our internal management reporting.

The increase reflects growth in \nMobility and Consumer Wireline revenues, partially offset by continued declines in\n Business Wireline revenues. Revenue increases also reflect higher revenues in our Mexico business unit, including favorable impacts from foreign exchange.\nOperations and support expenses \ndecreased in 2023, reflecting benefits of our continued transformation efforts, including lower personnel costs, partially offset by inflationary increases. The decrease also reflects lower Mobility equipment and associated selling costs, driven by lower device sales in 2023 and 3G network shutdown costs in the first quarter of 2022, higher returns on benefit-related assets and lower customer support costs. Partially offsetting the decreases were higher amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs and unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. \nAsset impairments and abandonments and restructuring \ndecreased in 2023, with higher impairments in 2022. Noncash charges in 2023 primarily relate to severance and restructuring charges, as well as the abandonment of non-deployed wireless equipment associated with our recently announced plans to collaborate with Ericsson to deploy commercial scale open radio access network (Open RAN), which will further the telecommunications industry efforts and align with the federal government\u2019s goal to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers. This network transformation is expected to result in additional cash charges in 2024. \nNoncash charges in 2022 were primarily due to the impairment of $24,812 of goodwill associated with our Business Wireline, Consumer Wireline and Mexico reporting units, and were driven by higher interest rates consistent with the macroeconomic environment, with secular declines also impacting Business Wireline growth rates (see Note 9). The charges in 2022 also included $1,413 of wireline conduit asset abandonments and $1,273 of restructuring and other impairment charges due to updated network build plans stemming from spectrum acquired in recent auctions, severance charges associated with transformation initiatives and impairment of personal protective equipment inventory.\n21\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nDepreciation and amortization \nexpense increased in 2023, primarily due to higher depreciation expense related to ongoing capital spending for strategic initiatives such as fiber and network upgrades. We expect depreciation expense to increase due to continued fiber and 5G investment and approximately $850 in 2024 due to the expected shortening of estimated economic lives of wireless equipment that will be replaced earlier than originally anticipated with our deployment of Open RAN.\nOperating income\n increased in 2023 and decreased in 2022. Our operating margin was 19.2% in 2023, compared to (3.8)% in 2022, which included noncash impairment charges, and 19.3% in 2021.\nInterest expense \nincreased\n \nin 2023, primarily due to lower capitalized interest associated with spectrum acquisitions and higher interest rates. Interest expense in 2023 also includes the reclassification of Mobility preferred interests distributions, which were repurchased on April 5, 2023 (see Note 16). Mobility preferred interest distributions were recorded as noncontrolling interest in 2022. \nLate in the third quarter of 2023, C-band incumbents completed their transition out of the spectrum band, allowing us to use all C-band licenses awarded to us in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction in 2021, and we have ceased capitalization of interest for licenses that have been placed into service. We expect interest expense to increase approximately $400 in 2024 as a result.\nEquity in net income of affiliates \ndecreased in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the performance of our investment in DIRECTV, which included our share of a gain on a sale-leaseback transaction by DIRECTV of approximately $100 in 2023 (see Notes 6, 10 and 19).\nOther income (expense) \u2013 net \ndecreased in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by actuarial remeasurement of pension plan assets and obligations, with net actuarial and settlement losses of $1,594 in 2023, compared to gains of $1,999 in 2022 (see Note 14). Also contributing to the decrease was a $450 impairment of an equity investment in a Latin America satellite business and lower net pension and postretirement benefit credits in 2023 (see Note 14). Partially offsetting the decrease were higher returns on other benefit-related investments.\nIncome tax expense \nincreased in 2023, primarily driven by higher income before income tax in 2023, partially offset by deferred tax benefits related to updated estimates.\nOur effective tax rate was 21.3% in 2023, (122.2)% in 2022, and 18.5% in 2021. The effective tax rate in 2022 was lower primarily due to our goodwill impairments associated with our Business Wireline, Consumer Wireline and Mexico reporting units, which are not deductible for tax purposes.\n22\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nSegment Results \nOur segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We evaluate segment performance based on operating income as well as EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin, which is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by total revenues.\nEffective for the first quarter of 2023, we stopped recording prior service credits to our individual business units or the corresponding charge to Corporate and Other, and segment operating expenses were recast to remove prior service credits from our historical reporting. Prior service credits are, and will continue to be, recorded as other income in our consolidated income statement in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (see Note 14). This recast increased Communications segment operations and support expenses by approximately $2,400 in 2022 and $2,100 in 2021.

Postpaid churn and postpaid phone-only churn were consistent with 2022.\nEquipment \nrevenue decreased in 2023, primarily driven by a lower volume of devices sold.\nOperations and support \nexpenses decreased in 2023, largely due to lower equipment costs, driven by lower device sales and associated selling costs, and 3G network shutdown costs in the first quarter of 2022. These decreases were offset by increased network expenses and higher amortization of deferred customer acquisition costs. \nDepreciation \nexpense increased in 2023, primarily due to ongoing capital spending for network upgrades and expansion. We expect increased depreciation expense in 2024 due to the expected shortening of estimated economic lives of wireless equipment that will be replaced earlier than originally anticipated with our Open RAN deployment and our network transformation and continued 5G investment.\nOperating income \nincreased in 2023 and 2022.

We believe that our simplified go-to-market strategy for 5G in underpenetrated markets will continue to contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth and that expansion of our fiber footprint and our multi-gig offerings will drive greater demand for broadband services on our fast-growing fiber network.\nAs we expand our fiber reach, we will be orienting our business portfolio to leverage this opportunity to offset continuing declines in legacy Business Wireline products by growing connectivity with small to mid-sized businesses. We plan to use our strong fiber and wireless assets, broad distribution and integrated product offers to strengthen our overall market position. We will continue to rationalize our product portfolio with a longer-term shift of the business to fiber and mobile connectivity, and growth in value-added services.\n2024 Expense Trends \nDuring 2024, we will continue to focus on efficiency, led by our cost transformation initiative. We expect the spending required to support growth and efficiency initiatives, primarily our continued deployment of fiber and 5G, including our deployment of Open RAN, and associated accelerated depreciation, to pressure expense trends in 2024. These investments will help prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services, including video streaming, augmented reality and \u201csmart\u201d technologies. The software benefits of our 5G wireless technology should result in a more efficient use of capital and lower network-related expenses in the coming years. Furthermore, to the extent customers upgrade their handsets in 2024, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\nWe continue to transform our operations to be more efficient and effective. We are restructuring businesses, sunsetting legacy networks, improving customer service and ordering functions through digital transformation, sizing our support costs and staffing with current activity levels, and reassessing overall benefit costs. We also expect cost savings through AI-driven efficiencies in our network design, software development and customer support services.\nMarket Conditions \nDuring 2023, uncertainty surrounding global growth rates, inflation, and an increasing interest rate environment continued to produce volatility in the credit, currency and equity markets. Additionally, several factors, including changes in workplace behavior that have continued since the COVID-19 pandemic, have resulted in changes in demand in business communication services. The global pandemic caused, and future public health emergencies could again cause, delays in the development, manufacturing (including the sourcing of key components) and shipment of products, as well as continued tight labor market and inflationary impacts. Most of our products and services are not directly affected by the imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods. However, we expect ongoing pressure on pricing during 2024 as we respond to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and our competitive marketplace, especially in wireless services.\nIncluded on our consolidated balance sheets are assets held by benefit plans for the payment of future benefits. Our pension plans are subject to funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). We expect only minimal ERISA contribution requirements to our pension plans for 2024. Investment returns on these assets depend largely on trends in the economy, and a weakness in the equity, fixed income and real asset markets could require us to make future contributions to the pension plans. In addition, our policy of recognizing actuarial gains and losses related to our pension and other postretirement plans in the period in which they arise subjects us to earnings volatility caused by changes in market conditions; however, these actuarial gains and losses do not impact segment performance as they are required to be recorded in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net.\u201d Changes in our discount rate, which are tied to changes in the bond market, and changes in the performance of equity markets, may have significant impacts on the valuation of our pension and other postretirement obligations at the end of 2024 (see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d).\nExpected Growth Areas \nOver the next few years, we expect our growth to come from wireless and IP-based fiber broadband services. We provide integrated services to diverse groups of customers in the U.S. on a converged telecommunications network utilizing different technological platforms. In 2024, our key initiatives include:\n\u2022\nContinuing our wireless subscriber momentum and 5G deployment, with expansion of 5G service, including to underpenetrated markets.\n\u2022\nContinuing our fiber deployment, improving fiber penetration, accelerating subscriber growth and increasing broadband revenues.\n\u2022\nDeploying Open RAN to build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers, fostering lower network costs, improved operational efficiencies and allowing for continued investment in our fast-growing broadband network.\n\u2022\nContinuing to drive efficiencies and a competitive advantage through cost transformation initiatives and product simplification. \n28\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nWireless\n \nWe expect to continue to deliver revenue growth in the coming years. We are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video and data usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for next-generation integrated services that combine technologies and services. As of December 31, 2023, we served 264 million wireless subscribers in North America, with 242 million in the United States. \nOur LTE technology covers over 438 million people in North America, and in the United States, we cover all major metropolitan areas and over 334 million people. When combined with our upgraded backhaul network, we provide enhanced network capabilities and superior mobile broadband speeds for data and video services. In December 2018, we introduced the nation\u2019s first commercial mobile 5G service and expanded that deployment nationwide in July 2020. At December 31, 2023, our network covers more than 302 million people with 5G technology in the United States and North America.\nOur networks covering both the U.S. and Mexico have enabled our customers to use wireless services without roaming on other companies\u2019 networks. We believe this seamless access will prove attractive to customers and provide a significant growth opportunity. At December 31, 2023, we provided LTE coverage to over 104 million people in Mexico.\nIntegration of Wireless and Fiber Services \nThe communications industry has evolved into internet-based technologies capable of converging the offering of wireline and wireless services. As the owner and operator of scaled wireless and fiber networks, we plan to focus on expanding our wireless network capabilities and providing broadband offerings that allow customers to integrate their home or business fixed services with their mobile service. In January 2022, we launched our multi-gig rollout, which brings the fastest internet to AT&T Fiber customers in select locations with symmetrical 2 gig and 5 gig tiers. We intend to continue to develop and provide unique integrated mobile and broadband/fiber solutions.\nREGULATORY LANDSCAPE\nAT&T subsidiaries operating within the United States are subject to federal and state regulatory authorities. While these issues may apply only to certain subsidiaries, the words \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cAT&T\u201d and \u201cour\u201d are used to simplify the discussion. The following discussions are intended as a condensed summary of the issues rather than as a comprehensive legal analysis and description of all of these specific issues.\nInternational Regulation \nOur subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authorities in the territories in which the subsidiaries operate. Our licensing, compliance and advocacy initiatives in foreign countries primarily enable the provision of enterprise (i.e., large business) services globally and wireless services in Mexico.\nThe General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in Europe in May of 2018. This regulation created a range of new compliance obligations and significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance. AT&T processes and handles personal data of its customers and subscribers, employees of its enterprise customers and its employees.\nFederal Regulation \nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Telecom Act), Congress established a national policy framework intended to bring the benefits of competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans by opening all telecommunications markets to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burdens that harm consumer welfare. Nonetheless, over the ensuing two decades, the FCC and some state regulatory commissions have maintained or expanded certain regulatory requirements that were imposed decades ago on our traditional wireline subsidiaries when they operated as legal monopolies. More recently, the FCC has pursued a more deregulatory agenda, eliminating a variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulations and streamlining its processes in a number of areas. We continue to support regulatory and legislative measures and efforts, at both the state and federal levels, to reduce inappropriate regulatory burdens that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed services to our customers, including initiatives to transition services from traditional networks to all IP-based networks. At the same time, we also seek to ensure that legacy regulations are not further extended to broadband or wireless services, which are subject to vigorous competition. We have organized the following discussion by service impacted.\nInternet\n The FCC currently classifies fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services, subject to light-touch regulation. In response to a challenge to the FCC\u2019s classification, in 2019, the D.C. Circuit upheld the FCC\u2019s current classification, although it remanded three discrete issues related to the effect of the classification on public safety, the regulation of pole attachments, and universal service support for low-income consumers through the Lifeline program to the FCC for further consideration. Since no party sought Supreme Court review of the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision to uphold the FCC\u2019s classification of broadband as an information service, that decision is final.\nIn October 2020, the FCC adopted an order addressing the three issues remanded by the D.C. Circuit for further consideration. After considering those issues, the FCC concluded there were no grounds to depart from its determination that fixed and mobile consumer broadband services should be classified as information services. An appeal of the FCC\u2019s remand decision is pending.\n29\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nOn September 28, 2023, the FCC released a draft Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) that was adopted at the FCC\u2019s open meeting on October 19, 2023. The NPRM proposes to again reclassify broadband internet access service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 and reestablish conduct rules for internet service providers. \nIn the interim, some states have adopted legislation or issued executive orders that would reimpose net neutrality rules repealed by the FCC. Suits were filed concerning such laws in California and Vermont. The California statute is now in effect. The litigation challenging the Vermont statute has been stayed pending the Second Circuit\u2019s disposition of an appeal by the State of New York of an order enjoining enforcement of a New York statute regulating broadband rates on the ground that such statute is preempted by federal law. We expect additional states may seek to impose net neutrality requirements in the future.\nOn November 15, 2023, the FCC adopted rules to \u201cfacilitate\u201d equal access to broadband and prevent digital discrimination in broadband access. The rules, which will become effective March 22, 2024, prohibit covered entities from implementing policies or practices not justified by genuine issues of technical or economic feasibility, that differentially impact consumers\u2019 access to broadband internet access service based on prohibited characteristics (including income level, race, and ethnicity) or that have such differential impact, whether intentional or not. The rules broadly apply prospectively to all aspects of an ISP\u2019s service that could impact a consumer\u2019s ability to access broadband, including deployment, marketing, and credit checks, among other things. We may be required to answer complaints alleging that the company has violated the FCC rules and those complaints may seek relief, including changes to our business practices or civil forfeitures that could result in significant costs or reputational harm. It is currently uncertain how the FCC will implement and enforce these new rules. Several business associations have filed appeals challenging the rules and several of those appeals have been consolidated in the Eighth Circuit.\n \n \nPrivacy-related legislation continues to be adopted or considered in a number of jurisdictions. Legislative, regulatory and litigation actions could result in increased costs of compliance, further regulation or claims against broadband internet access service providers and others, and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data.\nInfrastructure Investment \nOn November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) was signed into law. The legislation appropriates $65,000 to support broadband deployment and adoption. The National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) is responsible for distributing more than $48,000 of this funding, including $42,500 in state grants for broadband deployment projects in unserved and underserved areas. The IIJA also appropriated $14,200 for establishment of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), an FCC-administered monthly, low-income broadband benefit program, replacing the Emergency Broadband Benefit program (established in December 2020 by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021). Qualifying customers can receive up to thirty dollars per month (or seventy-five dollars per month for those on Tribal lands) to assist with their internet bill. AT&T is a participating provider in the ACP program and will consider participating in the deployment program where appropriate. The IIJA includes various provisions that have resulted in FCC proceedings regarding ACP program administration and consumer protection, reform of the existing universal support program, and broadband labeling and equal access. Absent additional funding, on January 11, 2024 the FCC announced that it currently projects April 2024 to be the last month providers will be fully reimbursed for the ACP benefit provided to enrolled households and established February 7, 2024 as the last date for new enrollments into the program.\nWireless \nIndustry-wide network densification and 5G technology expansion efforts, which are needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access, will involve significant deployment of \u201csmall cell\u201d equipment. This increases the importance of local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment in the public right-of-way on reasonable timelines and terms. The FCC has adopted multiple Orders streamlining federal, state, and local wireless structure review processes that had the tendency to delay and impede deployment of small cell and related infrastructure used to provide telecommunications and broadband services. During 2020-2021, we deployed 5G nationwide on \u201clow band\u201d spectrum on macro towers. Executing on the recent spectrum purchase, we announced ongoing construction and continuing deployment of 5G on C-band spectrum in 2022 and beyond. Additional spectrum will be needed industrywide for 5G and future services. In 2023, the federal government released a national spectrum strategy that focused on spectrum sharing and did not include specific timelines to make additional spectrum bands available for 5G and future generations of service. As a result, the federal government\u2019s ability and intent to make sufficient spectrum available to the industry in needed timeframes remains uncertain. \nIn June and November 2020, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling clarifying the limits on state and local authority to deny applications to modify existing structures to accommodate wireless facilities. Appeals of the November 2020 order remain pending in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. If sustained on appeal, these FCC decisions will remove state and local regulatory barriers and reduce the costs of the infrastructure needed for 5G and FirstNet deployments, which will enhance our ability to place small cell facilities on utility poles, expand existing facilities to accommodate public safety services, and replace legacy facilities and services with advanced broadband infrastructure and services. In 2022, we began deploying 5G nationwide on \u201clow band\u201d spectrum on macro towers. \n30\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nIn March 2020, the FCC released its order setting rules for certain spectrum bands (C-band) for 5G operations. In that order, the FCC concluded that C-band 5G services that met the agency\u2019s technical limits on power and emissions would not cause harmful interference with aircraft operations. In reliance on that order, AT&T bid a total of $23,406 and was awarded 1,621 C-band licenses, including 40 MHz available for deployment in December 2021, with the remainder available for deployment no later than December 2023. In late 2021, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) questioned whether the C-band launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplanes, which operate on spectrum bands over 400 MHz away from the spectrum AT&T launched in 2022 and 220 MHz away from spectrum AT&T launched in 2023. In response, to allow the FAA more time to evaluate, AT&T and Verizon delayed their planned December 2021 5G C-band launch by six weeks and voluntarily committed to a series of temporary, precautionary measures, in addition to deferring turning on a limited number of towers around certain airports. In 2023, we and all other C-band licensees entered into a voluntarily commitment to extend precautionary measures near certain airports through January 1, 2028, which may have limited impacts to deployments and services.\nIn recent years, the FCC took several actions to make spectrum available for 5G services, including the auction of 280 MHz of mid-band spectrum previously used for satellite service (the \u201cC Band\u201d auction) and 39 GHz band spectrum. AT&T obtained spectrum in these auctions. The FCC also made 150 MHz of mid-band CBRS spectrum available, to be shared with Federal incumbents, which enjoy priority. In addition, in 2022, the FCC completed Auction 110, in which AT&T won 40 MHz of 3.45 GHz spectrum nationwide at a cost of $9,079. (See Note 6)\nACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates \nBecause of the size of the financial statement line items they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our consolidated financial statements than others.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits \nOur actuarial estimates of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weighted-average assumptions are discussed in Note 14. Our assumed weighted-average discount rates for both pension and postretirement benefits of 5.00%, at December 31, 2023, reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants. We determined our discount rate based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations. These bonds had an average rating of at least Aa3 or AA- by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, denominated in U.S. dollars, and generally not callable, convertible or index linked. For the year ended December 31, 2023, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, we decreased our pension and postretirement discount rates each by 0.20%, resulting in an increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of $916 and an increase in our postretirement benefit obligation of $110.\nOur expected long-term rate of return was 7.50% on pension plan assets and 6.50% on postretirement plan assets for 2023. For 2024, we have increased our expected return on pension plan assets to 7.75%, reflecting higher yields for bonds and changes in the asset mix, and decreased our expected return on postretirement plan assets to 4.00%, reflecting reallocation of assets to cash for benefit payment. Our expected return on plan assets is calculated using the actual fair value of plan assets. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a 0.50% decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would cause 2024 combined pension and postretirement cost to increase $150, which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual returns in the current year upon remeasurement of our retiree benefit plans.\nWe recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in our consolidated statements of income. These gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31, and accordingly, will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter, unless an earlier remeasurement is required. Should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions, the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future years. See Note 14 for additional discussions regarding our assumptions.\nAsset Valuations and Impairments \nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested at least annually on October 1 for impairment. For impairment testing, we estimate fair values using models that predominantly rely on the expected cash flows to be derived from the reporting unit or use of the asset. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over the remaining life. Inputs underlying the expected cash flows include, but are not limited to, subscriber counts, revenue per user, capital investment and acquisition costs per subscriber, and ongoing operating costs. We based our assumptions on a combination of our historical results, trends, business plans and marketplace participant data.\nAnnual Goodwill Testing\nGoodwill is tested on a reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its book value. If the fair value exceeds the book value, then no impairment is measured. We estimate fair values using an income approach (also \n31\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nknown as a discounted cash flow model) and market multiple approaches. The income approach utilizes our future cash flow projections with a perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital. The market multiple approach uses the multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to those offered by the reporting units.\nAs of October 1, 2023, the calculated fair values of the reporting units exceeded their book values in all circumstances. However, the Consumer Wireline fair value exceeded its book value by less than 10%, with interest rates negatively impacting fair value offset by higher long-term cash flow projections driven by our fiber investment. For our Mobility and Business Wireline reporting units where fair values were in excess of 10%, if either the projected long-term growth rates declined by 0.5%, if the projected long-term EBITDA margin declined by 0.5%, or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by 0.5%, the fair values would still be higher than the book value of the reporting units. In the event of a 10% drop in the fair value of these reporting units, the fair value still would have exceeded the book value of the reporting units. \nFor the Consumer Wireline reporting unit, as of October 1, 2023, if the projected rate of long-term growth declined by 0.75%, if the projected long-term EBITDA margin declined by 4.0%, or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by 0.25%, it would result in impairment of the goodwill. \nThe fair values of our reporting units continue to be impacted by changes in the macroeconomic environment, namely increased weighted-average cost of capital. Also, inflation pressure and lower projected cash flows driven by secular declines, predominantly at Business Wireline, impacted the fair values. Future sustained declines in macroeconomic or business conditions, or higher discount rates or declines in the value of AT&T stock could result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. \nU.S. Wireless Licenses\nThe fair value of U.S. wireless licenses is assessed using a discounted cash flow model (the Greenfield Approach) and a qualitative corroborative market approach based on auction prices, depending upon auction activity. The Greenfield Approach assumes a company initially owns only the wireless licenses and makes investments required to build an operation comparable to current use. These licenses are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis, consistent with their use on a national scope for the United States. For impairment testing, we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected levels, with a long-term growth rate reflecting expected long-term inflation trends. We assume churn rates will initially exceed our current experience but decline to rates that are in line with industry-leading churn. We used a discount rate of 10%, based on the optimal long-term capital structure of a market participant and its associated cost of debt and equity for the licenses, to calculate the present value of the projected cash flows. If either the projected rate of long-term growth of cash flows or revenues declined by 0.5%, or if the discount rate increased by 0.5%, the fair values of these wireless licenses would still be higher than the book value. The fair value of these wireless licenses exceeded their book values by more than 10%.\nIncome Taxes \nOur estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in Note 13 and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements, giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimates. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or the final review of our tax returns by federal, state or foreign tax authorities.\nWe use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain positions that we have taken on tax returns and, if so, the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statements. We regularly review our uncertain tax positions and adjust our unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) in light of changes in facts and circumstances, such as changes in tax law, interactions with taxing authorities and developments in case law. These adjustments to our UTBs may affect our income tax expense. Settlement of uncertain tax positions may require use of our cash.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 for discussion of recently issued or adopted accounting standards.\nOTHER BUSINESS MATTERS \nGigapower, LLC\n On May 11, 2023, we closed the transaction with BlackRock, through a fund managed by its Diversified Infrastructure business, related to Gigapower, LLC (Gigapower). The joint venture will provide a fiber network to internet service providers and other businesses across the U.S. that serve customers outside of our wireline service area. We have agreed to contribute incremental funding of up to approximately $700, which will be funded as the network is constructed. We deconsolidated Gigapower\u2019s operations in the second quarter of 2023.\n32\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nLabor Contracts \nAs of January 31, 2024, we employed approximately 149,900 persons. Approximately 42% of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) or other unions. After expiration of the collective bargaining agreements, work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached. The main contracts set to expire in 2024 include the following:\n\u2022\nA contract covering approximately 5,000 Mobility employees in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas is set to expire in February.\n\u2022\nA wireline contract covering approximately 8,500 employees in California and Nevada is set to expire in April.\n\u2022\nThree wireline contracts covering approximately 15,000 employees in the southeastern United States are set to expire in August.\nInflation Reduction Act \nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Inflation Reduction Act) was enacted on August 16, 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act imposes a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on \u201capplicable corporations\u201d for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The CAMT is imposed to the extent the alternative minimum tax exceeds a company\u2019s regular tax liability. A corporation that pays alternative minimum tax is eligible for a credit against income tax in future years. Subject to future regulatory guidance, we currently do not believe the CAMT will have a material impact on our 2024 tax liability.\nOECD \nOn October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting which agreed to a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from digitalization of the economy. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of 15%. The OECD has continued to release additional guidance on the two-pillar framework throughout 2022 and 2023. Several jurisdictions, including the European Union, have enacted Pillar Two legislation with varying dates into force, including January 1, 2024 for certain components. There can be no assurance that these new rules will not increase our taxes in these countries and have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes, when enacted or enforced by participating countries in which we do business.\nEnvironmental \nWe are subject from time to time to judicial and administrative proceedings brought by various governmental authorities under federal, state or local environmental laws. We reference in our Forms 10-Q and 10-K certain environmental proceedings that could result in monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) of three hundred thousand dollars or more. However, we do not believe that any of those currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nContinuing operations for the years ended December 31, \n2023\n2022\n2021\nCash provided by operating activities\n$\n38,314\n\u00a0\n$\n35,812\u00a0\n$\n37,170\u00a0\nCash used in investing activities\n(19,660)\n(26,899)\n(32,489)\nCash (used in) provided by financing activities\n(15,614)\n(59,564)\n1,894\u00a0\nAt December 31, \n2023\n2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n6,722\n\u00a0\n$\n3,701\u00a0\nTotal debt\n137,331\n\u00a0\n135,890\u00a0\nWe had $6,722 in cash and cash equivalents available at December\u00a031, 2023, increasing $3,021 since December\u00a031, 2022. Cash and cash equivalents included cash of $1,368 and money market funds and other cash equivalents of $5,354. Approximately $1,381 of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our foreign entities in accounts predominantly outside of the U.S. and may be subject to restrictions on repatriation.\nIn 2023, cash inflows were primarily provided by cash receipts from operations, including cash from our sale and transfer of our receivables to third parties, issuance of commercial paper, long-term debt and cumulative preferred interests in subsidiaries and distributions from DIRECTV. These inflows exceeded cash used to meet the needs of the business, including, but not limited to, payment of operating expenses, funding capital expenditures and vendor financing payments, repayment of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, dividend payments to stockholders, and repurchase of the Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in AT&T Mobility II LLC (Mobility preferred interests). We maintain availability under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program to meet our short-term liquidity requirements.\nRefer to \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d discussion below for additional information regarding our cash requirements.\n33\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nCash Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations \nDuring 2023, cash provided by operating activities was $38,314 compared to $35,812 in 2022, reflecting operational growth and a focus to lower working capital programs, which resulted in lower device payments partially offset by lower receivable sales, net of remittances (see Note 17), and higher cash income tax payments. Cash from operating activities in 2022 also included higher voluntary benefit plan contributions. \nWe actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash. Among other things, we seek to make payments on 90-day or greater terms, while providing the suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payments at their cost (referred to as supplier financing program). In addition, for payments to suppliers of handset inventory, as part of our working capital initiatives, we have arrangements that allow us to extend the stated payment terms by up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (referred to as direct supplier financing). The net impact of direct supplier financing, including principal and interest payments, was to decrease cash from operating activities $299 in 2023 and improve cash from operating activities $851 in 2022. All supplier financing payments are due within one year. (See Note 22)\nCash Used in Investing Activities from Continuing Operations\nDuring 2023, cash used in investing activities totaled $19,660, consisting primarily of $17,853 (including interest during construction) for capital expenditures. In 2023, we received a return of investment of $2,049 from DIRECTV representing distributions in excess of cumulative equity in earnings from DIRECTV (see Note 10). We paid $2,221 of spectrum relocation and clearing costs in 2023, which we report as \u201cAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\u201d on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nFor capital improvements, we have negotiated favorable vendor payment terms of 120 days or more (referred to as vendor financing) with some of our vendors, which are excluded from capital expenditures and reported as financing activities. Vendor financing payments were $5,742 in 2023, compared to $4,697 in 2022. Capital expenditures in 2023 were $17,853, and when including $5,742 cash paid for vendor financing, capital investment was $23,595 ($728 lower than the prior year).\nThe vast majority of our capital expenditures are spent on our networks, including product development and related support systems. In 2023, we placed $2,651 of equipment in service under vendor financing arrangements (compared to $5,817 in 2022).\nThe amount of capital expenditures is influenced by demand for services and products, capacity needs and network enhancements. Our capital expenditures and vendor financing payments were slightly elevated in 2023, reflecting strategic investments. In 2024, we expect that our capital investment, which includes capital expenditures and cash paid for vendor financing, will be in the $21,000 to $22,000 range.\nCash Provided by or Used in Financing Activities from Continuing Operations \nIn 2023, cash used in financing activities totaled $15,614 and was comprised of debt issuances and repayments, payments of dividends, issuances and repurchase of preferred interests in subsidiaries and vendor financing payments.\n34\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nA tabular summary of our debt activity during 2023 is as follows:\nFirst\nQuarter\nSecond \nQuarter\nThird\nQuarter\nFourth\nQuarter\nFull Year 2023\nNet commercial paper borrowings\n$\n2,341\u00a0\n$\n1,284\u00a0\n$\n(112)\n$\n(2,436)\n$\n1,077\u00a0\nIssuance of notes and debentures:\nUSD notes\n$\n1,747\u00a0\n$\n2,730\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n4,477\u00a0\nEUR notes\n1,319\u00a0\n3,537\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n4,856\u00a0\nOther\n1,050\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n371\u00a0\n1,421\u00a0\nDebt issuances\n$\n4,116\u00a0\n$\n6,267\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n371\u00a0\n$\n10,754\u00a0\nRepayments:\nPrivate financing\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n(750)\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n(750)\nRepayments of other short-term borrowings\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n(750)\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n(750)\nUSD notes\n$\n(376)\n$\n(750)\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n(1,126)\nEUR notes\n(1,626)\n(473)\n(3,503)\n\u2014\u00a0\n(5,602)\nAUD notes\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(450)\n\u2014\u00a0\n(450)\n2025 Term Loan\n(2,500)\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n(2,500)\nOther\n(1,443)\n(441)\n(327)\n(155)\n(2,366)\nRepayments of long-term debt\n$\n(5,945)\n$\n(1,664)\n$\n(4,280)\n$\n(155)\n$\n(12,044)\nThe weighted average interest rate of our long-term debt portfolio, including credit agreement borrowings and the impact of derivatives, was approximately 4.2% as of December\u00a031, 2023 and 4.1% as of December\u00a031, 2022. We had $133,402 of total notes and debentures outstanding at December\u00a031, 2023. This also included Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc, and Australian dollar denominated debt that totaled approximately $35,192.\nAt December\u00a031, 2023, we had $9,477 of debt maturing within one year, consisting of $2,091 of commercial paper borrowings and $7,386 of long-term debt issuances. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 6.0% as of December\u00a031, 2023 and 4.8% as of December\u00a031, 2022.\nDuring 2023, we paid $5,742 of cash under our vendor financing program, compared to $4,697 in 2022. Total vendor financing payables included in our December\u00a031, 2023 consolidated balance sheet were $2,833, with $1,975 due within one year (in \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\u201d) and the remainder predominantly due within five years (in \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities\u201d).\nAt December\u00a031, 2023, we had approximately 144 million shares remaining from our share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors in 2014.\nWe paid dividends on common shares and preferred shares of $8,136 in 2023, compared with $9,859 in 2022. Dividends on common stock declared by our Board of Directors totaled $1.11 per share in 2023 and in 2022. Our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of AT&T and long-term growth opportunities.\nIn April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 sale of Telco LLC cumulative preferred interests and issued an additional $5,250 of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (April preferreds). The April preferreds pay an initial preferred distribution of 6.85% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2027, and every seven years thereafter. (See Note 16)\nIn April 2023, we also accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&T pension trust and repurchased the remaining 213 million Mobility preferred interests for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $5,414. The Mobility preferred interests had a redemption value of $5,320, with approximately $2,650 removed from \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\u201d and $2,670 removed from \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities.\u201d The repurchase was primarily funded with proceeds from the April 2023 issuances of Telco LLC preferred interests. (See Note 16)\nIn June 2023, we issued $2,000 of Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II LLC (Mobility noncontrolling interests), which pay cash distributions of 6.8% per annum, subject to declaration. The Mobility noncontrolling interests are included in \u201cRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. (See Note 16) \n35\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nOur 2024 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level and paying dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt, and asset sales. The timing and mix of any debt issuance and/or refinancing will be guided by credit market conditions and interest rate trends.\nCredit Facilities\nThe following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status. We currently have one $12,000 revolving credit agreement that terminates on November 18, 2028 (Revolving Credit Agreement). No amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December\u00a031, 2023.\nIn November 2022, we entered into and drew on a $2,500 term loan agreement due February 16, 2025 (2025 Term Loan), with Mizuho Bank, Ltd., as agent. On March 30, 2023, the 2025 Term Loan was paid off and terminated.\nWe also utilize other external financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.75-to-1. As of December\u00a031, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities.\nCollateral Arrangements\nMost of our counterparty collateral arrangements require cash collateral posting by AT&T only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. Under these arrangements, which cover the majority of our approximately $39,800 derivative portfolio, counterparties are still required to post collateral. During 2023, we received approximately $220 of cash collateral, on a net basis. Cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements. (See Note 12)\nOther\nOur total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year), redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders\u2019 equity. Our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investments. At December\u00a031, 2023, our debt ratio was 53.5%, compared to 56.1% at December\u00a031, 2022 and 48.9% at December\u00a031, 2021. The debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects our recent debt issuances, repayments and reclassifications related to redemption of noncontrolling interests.\nA significant amount of our cash outflows for continuing operations is related to tax items, acquisition of spectrum through FCC auctions and benefits paid for current and former employees:\n\u2022\nTotal taxes incurred, collected and remitted by AT&T during 2023 and 2022, were $16,877 and $16,630. These taxes include income, franchise, property, sales, excise, payroll, gross receipts and various other taxes and fees. \n\u2022\nTotal domestic spectrum acquired primarily through FCC auctions, including cash, exchanged spectrum, auction deposits and spectrum relocation and clearing costs was approximately $2,940 in 2023, $10,200 in 2022 and $25,400 in 2021.\n\u2022\nTotal health and welfare benefits provided to certain active and retired employees and their dependents totaled approximately $2,990 in 2023 and $3,200 in 2022, with $624 paid from plan assets in 2023 compared to $788 in 2022. Of those benefits, approximately $2,730 related to medical and prescription drug benefits in 2023 compared to $2,840 in 2022. In addition, in 2023, we prefunded $135 for future benefit payments versus $500 in 2022. We paid $4,863 of pension benefits out of plan assets in 2023 compared to $5,854 in 2022.\n36\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2023, and the estimated timing of payment, are in the following table:\nPayments Due By Period\nTotal\nLess than\n1 Year\n1-3\nYears\n3-5\nYears\nMore than\n5 Years\nLong-term debt obligations\n1\n$\n146,064\u00a0\n$\n7,537\u00a0\n$\n15,801\u00a0\n$\n13,215\u00a0\n$\n109,511\u00a0\nInterest payments on long-term debt\n2\n98,565\u00a0\n5,931\u00a0\n11,084\u00a0\n9,870\u00a0\n71,680\u00a0\nPurchase obligations\n3 \n29,507\u00a0\n7,555\u00a0\n12,856\u00a0\n8,187\u00a0\n909\u00a0\nOperating lease obligations\n4\n25,356\u00a0\n4,699\u00a0\n7,548\u00a0\n4,977\u00a0\n8,132\u00a0\nFirstNet sustainability payments\n5\n17,010\u00a0\n561\u00a0\n1,316\u00a0\n3,224\u00a0\n11,909\u00a0\nUnrecognized tax benefits (UTB)\n6\n9,238\u00a0\n392\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n\u2014\u00a0\n8,846\u00a0\nOther finance obligations\n7\n11,733\u00a0\n2,692\u00a0\n2,374\u00a0\n1,763\u00a0\n4,904\u00a0\nTotal Contractual Obligations\n$\n337,473\u00a0\n$\n29,367\u00a0\n$\n50,979\u00a0\n$\n41,236\u00a0\n$\n215,891\u00a0\n1\nRepresents principal or payoff amounts of notes, debentures and credit agreement borrowings at maturity (see Note 11).

    "item7a": ">ITEM 7A. \nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. These risks, along with other business risks, impact our cost of capital. It is our policy to manage our debt structure and foreign exchange exposure in order to manage capital costs, control financial risks and maintain financial flexibility over the long term. In managing market risks, we employ derivatives according to documented policies and procedures, including interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign currency exchange contracts and combined interest rate foreign currency contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We do not foresee significant changes in the strategies we use to manage market risk in the near future.\nOne of the most significant assumptions used in estimating our postretirement benefit obligations is the assumed weighted-average discount rate, which is the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligations could be effectively settled or paid out to participants. We determined our discount rate based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows for the obligations. In recent years, the discount rates have been increasingly volatile, and on average have been lower than in historical periods. Lower discount rates used to measure our pension and postretirement plans result in higher obligations. Future increases in these rates could result in lower obligations, improved funded status and actuarial gains.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe majority of our financial instruments are medium- and long-term fixed-rate notes and debentures. Changes in interest rates can lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of these instruments. The principal amounts by expected maturity, average interest rate and fair value of our liabilities that are exposed to interest rate risk are described in Notes 11 and 12. In managing interest expense, we control our mix of fixed- and floating-rate debt through term loans, floating rate notes, and interest rate swaps. We have established interest rate risk limits that we closely monitor by measuring interest rate sensitivities in our debt and interest rate derivatives portfolios.\n37\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nOur foreign-denominated long-term debt has been swapped from fixed-rate or floating-rate foreign currencies to fixed-rate U.S. dollars at issuance through cross-currency swaps, removing interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments. Likewise, periodically we enter into interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We expect gains or losses on our cross-currency swaps and interest rate locks to offset the losses and gains in the financial instruments they hedge.\nBelow are our interest rate derivatives subject to material interest rate risk as of December\u00a031, 2023. The interest rates illustrated below refer to the average rates we expect to pay based on current and implied forward rates and the average rates we expect to receive based on derivative contracts. The notional amount is the principal amount of the debt subject to the interest rate swap contracts\n. \nThe fair value asset (liability) represents the amount we would receive (pay) if we terminated the contracts as of December\u00a031, 2023.\nMaturity\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\nThereafter\nTotal\nFair Value 12/31/2023\nInterest Rate Derivatives\nInterest Rate Swaps:\nReceive Fixed/Pay\nVariable Notional\nAmount Maturing\n2\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n1,750\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n1,750\u00a0\n$\n(2)\nWeighted-Average\nVariable Rate Payable\n1,2\n5.0\u00a0\n%\n3.6\u00a0\n%\n3.3\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\nWeighted-Average\nFixed Rate Receivable\n5.5\u00a0\n%\n5.5\u00a0\n%\n5.5\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\u00a0\n%\n1\nInterest payable based on implied forward rates for the \nsecured overnight financing rate (\nSOFR) plus a spread of approximately 14 basis points.\n2\nDerivative is cancelable by the counterparty beginning in 2024.\nWe had no interest rate locks at December\u00a031, 2023.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe principally use foreign exchange contracts to hedge costs and debt denominated in foreign currencies. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through our foreign affiliates and equity investments in foreign companies. \nThrough cross-currency swaps, our foreign-denominated debt has been swapped from fixed-rate or floating-rate foreign currencies to fixed-rate U.S. dollars at issuance, removing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payments. We expect gains or losses in our cross-currency swaps to offset the gains and losses in the financial instruments they hedge. We had cross-currency swaps with a notional value of $38,006 and a fair value of $(3,177) outstanding at December\u00a031, 2023.\nFor the purpose of assessing specific risks, we use a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair value of our financial instruments and results of operations. We had no foreign exchange forward contracts at December\u00a031, 2023.\n38\nAT&T Inc.\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The integrity and objectivity of the data in these financial statements, including estimates and judgments relating to matters not concluded by year end, are the responsibility of management, as is all other information included in the Annual Report, unless otherwise indicated.\nThe financial statements of AT&T Inc. (AT&T) have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Management has made available to Ernst & Young LLP all of AT&T\u2019s financial records and related data, as well as the minutes of stockholders\u2019 and directors\u2019 meetings. Furthermore, management believes that all representations made to Ernst & Young LLP during its audit were valid and appropriate.\nManagement maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by AT&T is recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to its management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms.\nManagement also seeks to ensure the objectivity and integrity of its financial data by the careful selection of its managers, by organizational arrangements that provide an appropriate division of responsibility and by communication programs aimed at ensuring that its policies, standards and managerial authorities are understood throughout the organization.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors meets periodically with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors to review the manner in which they are performing their respective responsibilities and to discuss auditing, internal accounting controls and financial reporting matters. Both the internal auditors and the independent auditors periodically meet alone with the Audit Committee and have access to the Audit Committee at any time.\nAssessment of Internal Control\nThe management of AT&T is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. AT&T\u2019s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company\u2019s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nAT&T management assessed the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December\u00a031, 2023. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in \nInternal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework \n(2013 framework). Based on its assessment, AT&T management believes that, as of December\u00a031, 2023, the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nErnst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Annual Report, has issued an attestation report on the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\n/s/John T.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in stockholders\u2019 equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February\u00a023, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matters\n \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nDiscount rates used in determining pension and postretirement benefit obligations\nDescription of    the Matter\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension obligation was $33,227 million and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $30,098 million, resulting in an unfunded benefit obligation of $3,129 million. Additionally, at December 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s postretirement benefit obligation was $6,693 million and exceeded the fair value of postretirement plan assets of $1,763 million, resulting in an unfunded benefit obligation of $4,930 million. As explained in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the assumptions used to measure the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations, including discount rates, at December 31 or upon a remeasurement event. The Company determines the discount rates used to measure the obligations based on the development of a yield curve using high-quality corporate bonds selected to yield cash flows that correspond to the expected timing and amount of the expected future benefit payments. \n40\nAT&T Inc.\nAuditing the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations was complex due to the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions made by management, primarily the discount rates, used in the Company\u2019s measurement process. The discount rates have a significant effect on the measurement of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and auditing the discount rates was complex because it required an evaluation of the credit quality of the corporate bonds used to develop the discount rates and the correlation of those bonds\u2019 cash inflows to the timing and amount of future expected benefit payments.\nHow We \nAddressed the Matter in Our \nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain controls over management\u2019s review of the determination of the discount rates used in the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations calculations. \nTo test the determination of the discount rates used in the calculation of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations, we performed audit procedures that focused on evaluating, with the assistance of our actuarial specialists, the determination of the discount rates, among other procedures. For example, we evaluated the selected yield curve used to determine the discount rates applied in measuring the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations. As part of this assessment, we considered the credit quality of the corporate bonds that comprised the yield curve and compared the timing and amount of cash flows at maturity with the expected amounts and duration of the related benefit payments.\nEvaluation of goodwill for impairment\nDescription of    the Matter\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company\u2019s goodwill balance was $67,854 million. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, reporting unit goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment. Estimating fair values in connection with these impairment evaluations involves the utilization of discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches.\nAuditing management\u2019s annual goodwill impairment test for the Consumer Wireline and Business Wireline reporting units was complex because the estimation of fair values involves subjective management assumptions, such as projected terminal growth rates, projected long-term EBITDA margins, and weighted average cost of capital, and complex valuation methodologies, such as the discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches. Assumptions used in these valuation models are forward-looking, and changes in these assumptions can have a material effect on the determination of fair value.\nHow We Addressed the\nMatter in Our \nAudit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain controls over the Company\u2019s impairment evaluation processes. Our procedures included testing controls over management\u2019s review of the valuation models and its determination of the significant assumptions described above.\nOur audit procedures to test management\u2019s impairment evaluations included, among others, assessing the valuation methodologies and significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used to develop such assumptions. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, and other guideline companies in the same industry. Where appropriate, we evaluated whether changes to the Company\u2019s business and other factors would affect the significant assumptions. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management\u2019s estimates and performed independent sensitivity analyses. We involved our valuation specialists to assist us in evaluating the methodologies and auditing the assumptions used to calculate the estimated fair values of the Company\u2019s reporting units. \n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1999. \nDallas, Texas\nFebruary\u00a023, 2024\n41\nAT&T Inc.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AT&T Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n \nWe have audited AT&T Inc.\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AT&T Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February\u00a023, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n \n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\n \nDallas, Texas\nFebruary\u00a023, 2024\n42\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts",

Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation \nThroughout this document, AT&T Inc. is referred to as \u201cAT&T,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d or the \u201cCompany.\u201d The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries and affiliates which we control. AT&T is a holding company whose subsidiaries and affiliates operate worldwide in the telecommunications and technology industries. \nOn April 8, 2022, we completed the separation of our WarnerMedia business, which represented substantially all of our WarnerMedia segment, in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, under which Magallanes, Inc. (Spinco), a formerly wholly-owned subsidiary of AT&T that held the WarnerMedia business, was distributed to AT&T stockholders via a pro rata dividend, followed by the combination of Spinco with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery), which was renamed Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (WBD). (See Note 6)\nUpon the separation and distribution, the WarnerMedia business met the criteria for discontinued operations. For discontinued operations, we also evaluated transactions that were components of AT&T\u2019s single plan of a strategic shift, including dispositions that previously did not individually meet the criteria due to materiality, and have determined discontinued operations to be comprised of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic Ltd. (Playdemic). These businesses are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations, including for periods prior to the consummation of the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction. (See Notes 6 and 24) \nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG Capital (TPG) to form a new company named DIRECTV Entertainment Holdings, LLC (DIRECTV). With the close of the transaction, we separated and deconsolidated our Video business, comprised of our U.S. video operations, and began accounting for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method (see Notes 6, 10 and 19).\nAll significant intercompany transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Investments in subsidiaries and partnerships which we do not control but have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Earnings from certain investments accounted for using the equity method are included in our results on a one quarter lag. We also record our proportionate share of our equity method investees\u2019 other comprehensive income (OCI) items, including translation adjustments. We treat distributions received from equity method investees as returns on investment and classify them as cash flows from operating activities until those distributions exceed our cumulative equity in the earnings of that investment. We treat the excess amount as a return of investment and classify it as cash flows from investing activities.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions, including other estimates of fair value, probable losses and expenses, that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Moreover, unfavorable changes in market conditions, including interest rates, could adversely impact those estimates and result in asset impairments. Certain prior-period amounts have been conformed to the current period\u2019s presentation. Unless otherwise noted, the information in Notes 1 through 23 and 25 refer only to our continuing operations and do not include discussion of balances or activity of WarnerMedia, Vrio, Xandr and Playdemic, which are part of discontinued operations.\nAdopted and New Accounting Standards\nSupplier Finance Obligations \nAs of January 1, 2023, we adopted, with retrospective application, the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-04, \u201cLiabilities \u2013 Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\u201d (ASU 2022-04), which establishes interim and annual reporting disclosure requirements about a company\u2019s supplier finance programs for its purchase of goods and services. Interim and annual requirements include disclosure of outstanding amounts under the obligations as of the end of the reporting period, and annual requirements include a rollforward of those obligations for the annual reporting period, as well as a description of payment and other key terms of the programs. We elected to adopt the annual rollforward requirement for the year ended December 31, 2023, with prospective application (see Note 22). In the year of adoption, the disclosure of payment and other key terms under the programs and outstanding balances under the obligations also applies to interim reporting dates.\nConvertible Instruments\n\u00a0Beginning with 2022 interim reporting, we adopted, through retrospective application, ASU No. 2020-06, \u201cDebt\u2014Debt With Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging \u2013 Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity\u201d (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 requires that instruments which may be settled in cash or stock are presumed settled in stock in calculating diluted earnings per share. Prior to the April 2023 repurchase, settlement of our Series A Cumulative Perpetual Membership Interests in AT&T Mobility II LLC (Mobility preferred interests) could have resulted in additional \n49\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\ndilutive impact, the magnitude of which was influenced by the fair value of the Mobility preferred interests and the average AT&T common stock price during the reporting period, which varied from period-to-period (see Note 16).\nReference Rate Reform\n\u00a0In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, \u201cReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\u201d (ASU 2020-04, as amended), which provides optional expedients, and allows for certain exceptions to existing GAAP, for contract modifications triggered by the expected market transition of certain benchmark interest rates to alternative reference rates. ASU 2020-04 applies to contracts, hedging relationships, certain derivatives and other arrangements that reference the London Interbank Offering Rate (LIBOR) or any other rates ending after December 31, 2024. ASU 2020-04, as amended, became effective immediately. We do not believe our adoption of ASU 2020-04, including optional expedients, materially impacts our financial statements.\nSegment Reporting \nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, \u201cSegment Reporting (Topic 280):  Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\u201d (ASU 2023-07), which requires that a public entity disclose, on an interim and annual basis, significant segment expense categories and amounts that are regularly provided to its chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included in each reported measure of segment profit or loss. An entity must also disclose, by reportable segment, the amount and composition of other expenses. The standard requires an entity disclose the title and position of its CODM and explain how the CODM uses these reported measures in assessing segment performance and determining how to allocate resources. ASU 2023-07 will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 31, 2024, with retrospective application. The standard allows early adoption of these requirements; we are currently evaluating the disclosure impacts of our adoption.\nIncome Taxes \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, \u201cIncome Taxes (Topic 740):  Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\u201d (ASU 2023-09), which requires that a public entity disclose specific categories in its annual income tax rate reconciliation table and provide additional qualitative information for reconciling items representing at least 5% of pre-tax income or loss from continuing operations, using the federal statutory tax rate. The standard also requires an annual breakdown of income taxes paid by jurisdiction (i.e., federal, state and foreign), with further disaggregation by jurisdictions representing at least 5% of total income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with prospective application.\nAccounting Policies\nIncome Taxes \nWe record deferred income taxes for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the computed tax basis of those assets and liabilities. We record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets (included, together with our deferred income tax assets, as part of our reportable net deferred income tax liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets), for which the realization is uncertain. We review these items regularly in light of changes in federal, state and foreign tax laws and changes in our business.\nCash and Cash Equivalents \nCash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. The carrying amounts approximate fair value. At December 31, 2023, we held $\n1,368\n in cash and $\n5,354\n in money market funds and other cash equivalents. Of our total cash and cash equivalents, $\n1,381\n resided in foreign jurisdictions, some of which is subject to restrictions on repatriation.\nAllowance for Credit Losses \nWe record expense to maintain an allowance for credit losses for estimated losses that result from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments deemed collectible from the customer when the service was provided or product was delivered. When determining the allowances for trade receivables and loans, we consider the probability of recoverability of accounts receivable based on past experience, taking into account current collection trends and general economic factors, including bankruptcy rates. We also consider future economic trends to estimate expected credit losses over the lifetime of the asset. Credit risks are assessed based on historical write-offs, net of recoveries, as well as an analysis of the aged accounts receivable balances with allowances generally increasing as the receivable ages. Accounts receivable may be fully reserved for when specific collection issues are known to exist, such as catastrophes or pending bankruptcies.\nInventories \nInventories primarily consist of wireless devices and accessories and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value\n.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment \nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost, except for assets acquired through business combinations, which are initially recorded at fair value. The cost of additions and substantial improvements to property, plant and equipment is capitalized, and includes internal compensation costs for these projects. The cost of maintenance and repairs of property, plant and equipment is charged to operating expenses. Property, plant and equipment costs are depreciated using straight-line methods over their estimated economic lives. Certain subsidiaries follow composite group depreciation \n50\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nmethodology. Accordingly, when a portion of their depreciable property, plant and equipment is retired in the ordinary course of business, the gross book value is reclassified to accumulated depreciation, and no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of these assets.\nProperty, plant and equipment is reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable. We recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. (See Note 7)\nThe liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. In periods subsequent to initial measurement, we recognize period-to-period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revisions to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate. The increase in the carrying value of the associated long-lived asset is depreciated over the corresponding estimated economic life.\nSoftware Costs \nWe capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal-use software. Capitalized software costs are included in \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment \u2013 Net\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe amortize our capitalized software costs over a \nthree\n-year to \nseven\n-year period, reflecting the estimated period during which these assets will remain in service.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \nWe have the following major classes of intangible assets: goodwill; licenses, which include Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other wireless licenses; customer lists and relationships; and trademarks, trade names and various other finite-lived intangible assets (see Note 9).\nGoodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. Wireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communications services. While wireless licenses are issued for a fixed period of time (generally \nten years\n), renewals of domestic wireless licenses have occurred routinely and at nominal cost. We have determined that there are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful lives of our FCC wireless licenses.\nWe amortize our wireless licenses in Mexico over their average remaining economic life of \n25\n years.\nWe acquired the rights to the AT&T and other trade names in previous acquisitions, classifying certain of those trade names as indefinite-lived. We have the effective ability to retain these exclusive rights permanently at a nominal cost.\nGoodwill, FCC wireless licenses and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment (see Note 9). The testing is performed on the value as of October 1 each year and compares the book values of the assets to their fair values. Goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying amount of each reporting unit, deemed to be our principal operating segments or one level below them, to the fair value using both discounted cash flow as well as market multiple approaches. FCC wireless licenses are tested on an aggregate basis, consistent with our use of the licenses on a national scope, using a discounted cash flow approach. Trade names are tested by comparing their book values to their fair values calculated using a discounted cash flow approach on a presumed royalty rate derived from the revenues related to each brand name.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated economic lives (see Note 9). Customer lists and relationships are amortized using primarily the sum-of-the-months-digits method of amortization over the period in which those relationships are expected to contribute to our future cash flows. Finite-lived trademarks and trade names are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the assets. The remaining finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method. These assets, along with other long-lived assets, are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable.\nAdvertising Costs \nWe expense advertising costs for products and services or for promoting our corporate image as incurred (see Note 23).\nForeign Currency Translation \nOur foreign subsidiaries and foreign investments generally report their earnings in their local currencies.

SEGMENT INFORMATION\nOur segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have \ntwo\n reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.\nWe also evaluate segment and business unit performance based on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin, which is defined as operating income excluding depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by total revenue.\n53\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nEffective for the first quarter of 2023, we stopped recording prior service credits to our individual business units or the corresponding charge to Corporate and Other, and segment operating expenses were recast to remove prior service credits from our historical reporting. Prior service credits are, and will continue to be, recorded as other income in our consolidated income statement in accordance with GAAP. This recast increased Communications segment operations and support expenses by approximately $\n2,400\n in 2022 and $\n2,100\n in 2021. Correspondingly, this recast lowered administrative expenses within Corporate and Other, with no change on a consolidated basis.\nThe \nCommunications segment \nprovides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect integrated product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:\n\u2022\nMobility \nprovides nationwide wireless service and equipment.\n\u2022\nBusiness Wireline \nprovides advanced ethernet-based fiber services, IP Voice and managed professional services, as well as traditional voice and data services and related equipment to business customers.\n\u2022\nConsumer Wireline \nprovides broadband services, including fiber connections that provide multi-gig services to residential customers in select locations and our fixed wireless access product that provides home internet services delivered over our 5G wireless network where available. Consumer Wireline also provides legacy telephony voice communication services. \nThe \nLatin America segment \nprovides wireless services and equipment in Mexico.\nCorporate \nand\n Other \nreconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes.\nCorporate includes\n:\n\u2022\nDTV-related retained costs\n, which are costs previously allocated to the Video business that were retained after the transaction, net of reimbursements from DIRECTV under transition service agreements.\n\u2022\nParent administration support\n, which includes costs borne by AT&T where the business units do not influence decision making.\n\u2022\nSecuritization fees\n associated with our sales of receivables (see Note 17).\n\u2022\nValue portfolio\n, which are businesses no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market. \nOther items consist of\n:\n\u2022\nVideo, \nwhich includes our former U.S. video operations that were contributed to DIRECTV on July 31, 2021 (see Note 19).\n\u2022\nHeld-for-sale and other reclassifications, \nwhich\n \nincludes our former Crunchyroll and Government Solutions businesses.\n\u2022\nCertain significant items\n,\u00a0which includes items associated with the merger and integration of acquired or divested businesses, including amortization of intangible assets, employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, asset impairments and abandonments and restructuring, and other items for which the segments are not being evaluated.\n\u2022\nEliminations and consolidations\n, removed transactions involving dealings between Mobility and our Video business, prior to the July 31, 2021 separation of Video.\n\u201cInterest expense\u201d and \u201cOther income

5. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nWe report our revenues net of sales taxes and record certain regulatory fees, primarily Universal Service Fund (USF) fees, on a net basis. No customer accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues in 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nWireless, Advanced Data, Legacy Voice & Data Services and Equipment Revenue\nWe offer service-only contracts and contracts that bundle equipment used to access the services and/or with other service offerings. Some contracts have fixed terms and others are cancelable on a short-term basis (i.e., month-to-month arrangements).\nExamples of service revenues include wireless, strategic services (e.g., virtual private network service), and legacy voice and data (e.g., traditional local and long-distance). These services represent a series of distinct services that is considered a separate performance obligation. Service revenue is recognized when services are provided, based upon either usage (e.g., bytes of data processed) or period of time (e.g., monthly service fees).\nSome of our services require customer premises equipment that, when combined and integrated with AT&T\u2019s specific network infrastructure, facilitates the delivery of service to the customer. In evaluating whether the equipment is a separate performance obligation, we consider the customer\u2019s ability to benefit from the equipment on its own or together with other readily available resources and if so, whether the service and equipment are separately identifiable (i.e., is the service highly dependent on, or highly interrelated with the equipment). When equipment is a separate performance obligation, we record the sale of equipment when title has passed and the products are accepted by the customer. For devices sold through indirect channels (e.g., national retailers), revenue is recognized when the retailer accepts the device, not upon activation.\nOur equipment and service revenues are predominantly recognized on a gross basis, as most of our services do not involve a third party and we typically control the equipment that is sold to our customers.\nRevenue recognized from fixed term contracts that bundle services and/or equipment is allocated based on the standalone selling price of all required performance obligations of the contract (i.e., each item included in the bundle). Promotional discounts are attributed to each required component of the arrangement, resulting in recognition over the contract term. \n57\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nStandalone selling prices are determined by assessing prices paid for service-only contracts (e.g., arrangements where customers bring their own devices) and standalone device pricing.\nWe offer the majority of our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a specified period of time, and, in many cases, they may be eligible to trade in the original equipment for a new device and have the remaining unpaid balance paid or settled. For customers that elect these equipment installment payment programs, at the point of sale, we recognize revenue for the entire amount of revenue allocated to the customer receivable net of fair value of the trade-in right guarantee, when applicable. The difference between the revenue recognized and the consideration received is recorded as a note receivable when the devices are not discounted and our right to consideration is unconditional. When installment sales include promotional discounts that are earned by customers over the contract term (e.g., \u201cbuy one get one free\u201d or equipment discounts with trade-in of a device), notes receivable are recognized net of discounts and the difference between revenue recognized and consideration received is recorded as a contract asset to be amortized over the contract term.\n \nLess commonly, we offer certain customers highly discounted devices when they enter into a minimum service agreement term. For these contracts, we recognize equipment revenue at the point of sale based on a standalone selling price allocation. The difference between the revenue recognized and the cash received is recorded as a contract asset that will amortize over the contract term.\nOur contracts allow for customers to frequently modify their arrangement, without incurring penalties in many cases. When a contract is modified, we evaluate the change in scope or price of the contract to determine if the modification should be treated as a new contract or if it should be considered a change of the existing contract. We generally do not have significant impacts from contract modifications.\nRevenues from transactions between us and our customers are recorded net of revenue-based regulatory fees and taxes. Cash incentives given to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Nonrefundable, upfront service activation and setup fees associated with service arrangements are deferred and recognized over the associated service contract period or customer relationship life.\nRevenue Categories\nThe following tables set forth reported revenue by category and by business unit:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023\n\u00a0\nCommunications\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMobility\nBusiness Wireline\nConsumer Wireline\nLatin America\nCorporate & Other\nElim.\n \nTotal\nWireless service\n$\n63,175\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n2,569\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n65,744\n\u00a0\nBusiness service\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n20,274\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n20,274\n\u00a0\nBroadband\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n10,455\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n10,455\n\u00a0\nLegacy voice and data\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,508\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n294\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,802\n\u00a0\nOther\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,210\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n164\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,374\n\u00a0\nTotal Service\n63,175\n\u00a0\n20,274\n\u00a0\n13,173\n\u00a0\n2,569\n\u00a0\n458\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n99,649\n\u00a0\nEquipment\n20,807\n\u00a0\n609\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,363\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n22,779\n\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n83,982\n\u00a0\n$\n20,883\n\u00a0\n$\n13,173\n\u00a0\n$\n3,932\n\u00a0\n$\n458\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n122,428\n\u00a0\n58\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022\nCommunications\nMobility\nBusiness Wireline\nConsumer Wireline\nLatin America\nCorporate & Other\nElim.\n \nTotal\nWireless service\n$\n60,499\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n2,162\n\u00a0\n$\n13\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n62,674\n\u00a0\nBusiness service\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n21,891\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n21,891\n\u00a0\nBroadband\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n9,669\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n9,669\n\u00a0\nLegacy voice and data\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,746\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n323\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n2,069\n\u00a0\nOther\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,334\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n194\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,528\n\u00a0\nTotal Service\n60,499\n\u00a0\n21,891\n\u00a0\n12,749\n\u00a0\n2,162\n\u00a0\n530\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n97,831\n\u00a0\nEquipment\n21,281\n\u00a0\n647\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n982\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n22,910\n\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n81,780\n\u00a0\n$\n22,538\n\u00a0\n$\n12,749\n\u00a0\n$\n3,144\n\u00a0\n$\n530\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n120,741\n\u00a0\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021\nCommunications\nMobility\nBusiness Wireline\nConsumer Wireline\nLatin America\nCorporate & Other\nElim.\n \nTotal\nWireless service\n$\n57,590\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n1,834\n\u00a0\n$\n74\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n$\n59,498\n\u00a0\nVideo service\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n15,423\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n15,423\n\u00a0\nBusiness service\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n23,224\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n70\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n23,294\n\u00a0\nBroadband\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n9,085\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n9,085\n\u00a0\nLegacy voice and data\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,977\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n429\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n2,406\n\u00a0\nOther\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1,384\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n611\n\u00a0\n(\n136\n)\n1,859\n\u00a0\nTotal Service\n57,590\n\u00a0\n23,224\n\u00a0\n12,446\n\u00a0\n1,834\n\u00a0\n16,607\n\u00a0\n(\n136\n)\n111,565\n\u00a0\nEquipment\n20,664\n\u00a0\n713\n\u00a0\n93\n\u00a0\n913\n\u00a0\n90\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n22,473\n\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n78,254\n\u00a0\n$\n23,937\n\u00a0\n$\n12,539\n\u00a0\n$\n2,747\n\u00a0\n$\n16,697\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n136\n)\n$\n134,038\n\u00a0\nDeferred Customer Contract Acquisition and Fulfillment Costs\nCosts to acquire and fulfill customer contracts, including commissions on service activations, for our Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline services, are deferred and amortized over the contract period or expected customer relationship life, which typically ranges from \nthree years\n to \nfive years\n. \nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we updated our analysis of expected economic lives of customer relationships. As of January 1, 2022, we extended the amortization period for deferred acquisition and fulfillment contract costs within Mobility, Business Wireline, and Consumer Wireline to better reflect the estimated economic lives of the relationships. These changes in accounting estimate decreased \u201cOther cost of revenues\u201d approximately $\n395\n, or $\n0.04\n per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following table presents the deferred customer contract acquisition and fulfillment costs included on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n2023\n2022\nDeferred Acquisition Costs\nPrepaid and other current assets\n$\n3,233\n\u00a0\n$\n2,893\n\u00a0\nOther Assets\n4,077\n\u00a0\n3,913\n\u00a0\nTotal deferred customer contract acquisition costs\n$\n7,310\n\u00a0\n$\n6,806\n\u00a0\nDeferred Fulfillment Costs\nPrepaid and other current assets\n$\n2,340\n\u00a0\n$\n2,481\n\u00a0\nOther Assets\n3,843\n\u00a0\n4,206\n\u00a0\nTotal deferred customer contract fulfillment costs\n$\n6,183\n\u00a0\n$\n6,687\n\u00a0\n59\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nThe following table presents deferred customer contract acquisition and fulfillment cost amortization, which are primarily included in \u201cSelling, general and administrative\u201d and \u201cOther cost of revenues,\u201d respectively, for the years ended December 31:\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n2023\n2022\nDeferred acquisition cost amortization\n$\n3,476\n\u00a0\n$\n2,935\n\u00a0\nDeferred fulfillment cost amortization\n2,700\n\u00a0\n2,688\n\u00a0\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nA contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of our right to bill and receive consideration. The contract asset will decrease as services are provided and billed. For example, when installment sales include promotional discounts (e.g., trade-in device credits) the difference between revenue recognized and consideration received is recorded as a contract asset to be amortized over the contract term.\nOur contract assets primarily relate to our wireless businesses. Promotional equipment sales where we offer handset credits, which are allocated between equipment and service in proportion to their standalone selling prices, when customers commit to a specified service period result in additional contract assets recognized. These contract assets will amortize over the service contract period, resulting in lower future service revenue. \nWhen consideration is received in advance of the delivery of goods or services, a contract liability is recorded. Reductions in the contract liability will be recorded as we satisfy the performance obligations.\nThe following table presents contract assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n2023\n2022\nContract asset\n$\n6,518\n\u00a0\n$\n5,512\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Current portion in \u201cPrepaid and other current assets\u201d\n3,549\n\u00a0\n2,941\nContract liability\n3,994\n\u00a0\n4,170\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Current portion in \u201cAdvanced billings and customer deposits\u201d\n3,666\n\u00a0\n3,816\nOur contract asset balance in 2023 reflects increased promotional equipment sales in our wireless business.\nOur beginning of period contract liabilities recorded as customer contract revenue during 2023 was $\n3,830\n.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent services we are required to provide to customers under bundled or discounted arrangements, which are satisfied as services are provided over the contract term. In determining the transaction price allocated, we do not include non-recurring charges and estimates for usage, nor do we consider arrangements with an original expected duration of less than one year, which are primarily prepaid wireless and residential internet agreements.\nRemaining performance obligations associated with business contracts reflect recurring charges billed, adjusted to reflect estimates for sales incentives and revenue adjustments. Performance obligations associated with wireless contracts are estimated using a portfolio approach in which we review all relevant promotional activities, calculating the remaining performance obligation using the average service component for the portfolio and the average device price. As of December\u00a031, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $\n38,613\n, of which we expect to recognize approximately\u00a0\n82\n% by the end of 2025, with the balance recognized thereafter.\nNOTE 6. ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS\nAcquisitions\nSpectrum Auctions \nOn January 14, 2022, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that we were the winning bidder for \n1,624\n 3.45 GHz licenses in Auction 110. We provided the FCC an upfront deposit of $\n123\n in the third quarter of 2021 and paid the remaining $\n8,956\n in the first quarter of 2022, for a total of $\n9,079\n. We funded the purchase price using cash and short-term investments. We received the licenses in May 2022 and classified the auction deposits and related capitalized interest as \u201cLicenses \u2013 Net\u201d on our December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet.\n60\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nIn February 2021, the FCC announced that AT&T was the winning bidder for \n1,621\n C-Band licenses, comprised of a total of 80 MHz nationwide, including 40 MHz in Phase I. We provided to the FCC an upfront deposit of $\n550\n in 2020 and cash payments totaling $\n22,856\n in the first quarter of 2021, for a total of $\n23,406\n. We received the licenses in July 2021 and classified the auction deposits, related capitalized interest and billed relocation costs as \u201cLicenses \u2013 Net\u201d on our December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet. In December 2021, we paid $\n955\n of Incentive Payments upon clearing of Phase I spectrum and paid $\n2,112\n upon clearing of Phase II spectrum in 2023. Additionally, we are responsible for approximately $\n1,100\n of compensable relocation costs over the next several years as the spectrum is being cleared by satellite operators, of which we paid $\n650\n in 2021, $\n98\n in 2022 and $\n109\n in 2023. Funding for the purchase price of the spectrum included a combination of cash on hand and short-term investments, as well as short- and long-term debt.\nCash paid, including spectrum deposits (net of refunds), capitalized interest, and any payments for incentive and relocation costs are included in \u201cAcquisitions, net of cash acquired\u201d on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Interest is capitalized until the spectrum is ready for its intended use. \nDispositions\nVideo Business \nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV, which is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions, most significantly the appointment and removal of the CEO.\nIn connection with the transaction, we contributed our U.S. Video business unit to DIRECTV for $\n4,250\n of junior preferred units, an additional distribution preference of $\n4,200\n and a \n70\n% economic interest in common units (collectively \u201cequity considerations\u201d). TPG contributed approximately $\n1,800\n in cash to DIRECTV for $\n1,800\n of senior preferred units and a \n30\n% economic interest in common units. See Note 10 for additional information on our accounting for our investment in DIRECTV.\nUpon close of the transaction in the third quarter of 2021, we received approximately $\n7,170\n in cash from DIRECTV ($\n7,600\n, net of $\n430\n cash on hand) and transferred $\n195\n of DIRECTV debt. Approximately $\n1,800\n of the cash received is reported as cash received from financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows, as it related to a note payable to DIRECTV, for which payment was tied to our agreement to cover net losses under the remaining term of the NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract up to a cap of $\n2,100\n over the remaining period of the contract (see Note 19). The remainder of the net proceeds is reported as cash from investing activities. This transaction did not result in a material gain or loss.\nDispositions Reflected as Discontinued Operations\nWarnerMedia\n On April 8, 2022, we completed the separation and distribution of our WarnerMedia business, and merger of Spinco, an AT&T subsidiary formed to hold the WarnerMedia business, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc., which was renamed Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc (WBD). \nEach AT&T shareholder was entitled to receive 0.241917 shares of WBD common stock for each share of AT&T common stock held as of the record date\n, which represented approximately \n71\n% of WBD. In connection with and in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement (SDA), prior to the distribution and merger, AT&T received approximately $\n40,400\n, which includes $\n38,800\n of Spinco cash and $\n1,600\n of debt retained by WarnerMedia. During the second quarter of 2022, $\n45,041\n of retained earnings and $\n5,632\n of additional paid-in capital associated with the transaction were removed from our balance sheet. Additionally, in August 2022, we and WBD finalized the post-closing adjustment, pursuant to Section 1.3 of the SDA, which resulted in a $\n1,200\n payment to WBD in the third quarter of 2022 and was reflected in the balance sheet as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. (See Note 24)\nXandr\n On June 6, 2022, we completed the sale of the marketplace component of Xandr to Microsoft Corporation. Xandr was reflected in our historical financial statements as discontinued operations. \nVrio\n On November 15, 2021, we completed the sale of our Latin America video operations, Vrio, to Grupo Werthein and recorded a note receivable of $\n610\n to be paid over \nfour years\n, of which $\n300\n is in the form of seller financing and the remainder is related to working capital adjustments. In the second quarter of 2021, we classified the Vrio disposal group as held-for-sale and reported the disposal group at fair value less cost to sell, which resulted in a noncash, pre-tax impairment charge of $\n4,555\n, including approximately $\n2,100\n related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments and $\n2,500\n related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Approximately $\n80\n of the impairment was attributable to noncontrolling interest. This disposition did not result in a net material gain or loss.\nOtter Media\n During the third quarter of 2021, we disposed of substantially all of the assets of Otter Media. We received approximately $\n1,540\n in cash. The disposition did not result in a material gain or loss.\n61\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nPlaydemic Ltd.\n On September 20, 2021, we sold WarnerMedia\u2019s mobile games app studio, Playdemic for approximately $\n1,370\n in cash and recognized a pre-tax gain of $\n706\n in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net,\u201d on our consolidated statement of income.\n \nNOTE 7.

Depreciation expense included amortization of software totaling $\n3,023\n in 2023, $\n2,972\n in 2022 and $\n2,909\n in 2021.\nIn December 2022, we recorded a noncash pre-tax charge of $\n1,413\n to abandon conduits that will not be utilized to support future network activity. The abandonment was considered outside the ordinary course of business.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we updated our analysis of economic lives of AT&T owned fiber network assets. As of January 1, 2022, we extended the estimated economic life and depreciation period of such costs to better reflect the physical life of the assets that we had been experiencing and absence of technological changes that would replace fiber as the best broadband technology in the industry. The change in accounting estimate decreased depreciation expense $\n280\n, or $\n0.03\n per diluted share from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNOTE 8. LEASES\nWe have operating and finance leases for certain facilities and equipment used in our operations. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to \n15\n years. Some of our operating leases (e.g., for towers and real estate) contain renewal options that may be exercised, and some of our leases include options to terminate the leases within one year.\nWe have recognized a right-of-use asset for both operating and finance leases, and a corresponding lease liability that represents the present value of our obligation to make payments over the lease term. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating and finance leases, which was determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. We use the unsecured borrowing rate and risk-adjust that rate to approximate a collateralized rate in the currency of the lease, which will be updated on a quarterly basis for measurement of new lease liabilities.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\n2023\n2022\n2021\nOperating lease cost\n$\n5,577\n$\n5,437\n$\n5,363\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of leased assets in property, plant and equipment\n$\n232\n$\n204\n$\n179\nInterest on lease obligation\n184\n159\n145\nTotal finance lease cost\n$\n416\n$\n363\n$\n324\n62\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nThe following table provides supplemental cash flows information related to leases:\n2023\n2022\n2021\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash paid for amounts included in lease obligations:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n$\n4,588\n$\n4,679\n$\n4,580\nSupplemental Lease Cash Flow Disclosures\nOperating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0new operating lease obligations\n2,693\n3,751\n3,396\nThe following tables set forth supplemental balance sheet information related to leases at December 31:\n2023\n2022\nOperating Leases\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n$\n20,905\n\u00a0\n$\n21,814\n\u00a0\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n$\n3,524\n\u00a0\n$\n3,547\n\u00a0\nOperating lease obligation\n17,568\n\u00a0\n18,659\n\u00a0\nTotal operating lease obligation\n$\n21,092\n\u00a0\n$\n22,206\n\u00a0\nFinance Leases\nProperty, plant and equipment, at cost\n$\n2,828\n\u00a0\n$\n2,770\n\u00a0\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n(\n1,399\n)\n(\n1,224\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment \u2013 net\n$\n1,429\n\u00a0\n$\n1,546\n\u00a0\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n$\n183\n\u00a0\n$\n170\n\u00a0\nLong-term debt\n1,655\n\u00a0\n1,647\n\u00a0\nTotal finance lease obligation\n$\n1,838\n\u00a0\n$\n1,817\n\u00a0\n2023\n2022\nWeighted-Average Remaining Lease Term (years)\nOperating leases\n7.7\n8.1\nFinance leases\n7.2\n7.9\nWeighted-Average Discount Rate\nOperating leases\n4.1\n\u00a0\n%\n3.7\n\u00a0\n%\nFinance leases\n8.3\n\u00a0\n%\n8.0\n\u00a0\n%\n63\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nThe following table provides the expected future minimum maturities of lease obligations:\nAt December 31, 2023\nOperating Leases\nFinance \nLeases\n2024\n$\n4,699\n\u00a0\n$\n334\n\u00a0\n2025\n4,105\n\u00a0\n338\n\u00a0\n2026\n3,443\n\u00a0\n331\n\u00a0\n2027\n2,805\n\u00a0\n331\n\u00a0\n2028\n2,172\n\u00a0\n334\n\u00a0\nThereafter\n8,132\n\u00a0\n840\n\u00a0\nTotal lease payments\n25,356\n\u00a0\n2,508\n\u00a0\nLess: imputed interest\n(\n4,264\n)\n(\n670\n)\nTotal\n$\n21,092\n\u00a0\n$\n1,838\n\u00a0\nNOTE 9. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nWe test goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level, which is deemed to be our principal operating segments or one level below. With our annual impairment testing as of October 1, the calculated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its book value; however, the Consumer Wireline fair value exceeded its book value by less than 10%, with interest rates negatively impacting fair value, offset by higher long-term cash flow projections driven by our fiber investment.\nIn 2022, we recorded noncash impairment charges of $\n13,478\n in our Business Wireline reporting unit, $\n10,508\n in our Consumer Wireline reporting unit and $\n826\n in our Mexico reporting unit. The decline in fair values was primarily due to changes in the macroeconomic environment, namely increased weighted-average cost of capital. Also, inflation pressure and lower projected cash flows driven by secular declines, predominantly at Business Wireline, impacted the fair values. A combination of discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches was used to determine the fair values. In the Communications segment, if all other assumptions were to remain unchanged, we expect the impairment charge would have increased by approximately $\n3,400\n if the weighted average cost of capital increased by 25 basis points, or $\n2,100\n if the projected terminal growth rate declined by 25 basis points, or $\n2,800\n if the projected long-term EBITDA margin declined 100 basis points.\nChanges to our goodwill in 2023 primarily resulted from goodwill attributed to assets contributed to the formation of strategic joint ventures. Changes to our goodwill in 2022 primarily resulted from the noncash impairments discussed above.\nAt December 31, 2023, our Communications segment has three reporting units: Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline. The reporting unit is deemed to be the operating segment for Latin America.\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill by operating segment:\n2023\n2022\nBalance at\nJan. 1\nDispositions \nand other\nBalance at\nDec. 31\nBalance at\nJan. 1\nImpairments\nDispositions, \ncurrency \nexchange \nand other \nBalance at\nDec. 31\nCommunications\nGoodwill\n$\n91,881\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n41\n)\n$\n91,840\n\u00a0\n$\n91,924\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\u00a0\n$\n(\n43\n)\n$\n91,881\n\u00a0\nAccumulated\nImpairments\n(\n23,986\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n(\n23,986\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n(\n23,986\n)\n\u2014\u00a0\n(\n23,986\n)\nNet goodwill\n67,895\n\u00a0\n(\n41\n)\n67,854\n\u00a0\n91,924\n\u00a0\n(\n23,986\n)\n(\n43\n)\n67,895\n\u00a0\nLatin America\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n816\n\u00a0\n(\n826\n)\n10\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n67,895\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n41\n)\n$\n67,854\n\u00a0\n$\n92,740\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n24,812\n)\n$\n(\n33\n)\n$\n67,895\n\u00a0\nWe review amortizing intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining life of the asset or asset group.\n64\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nIndefinite-lived wireless licenses increased in 2023 primarily due to compensable relocation and incentive payments and $\n695\n of capitalized interest (see Notes 6 and 23).\nIndefinite-lived wireless licenses increased in 2022 primarily due to auction activity and $\n1,120\n of capitalized interest (see Notes 6 and 23).\nOur other intangible assets at December 31 are summarized as follows:\n2023\n2022\nOther Intangible Assets\nWeighted-Average \nLife\nGross \nCarrying \nAmount\nAccumulated \nAmortization\nCurrency \nTranslation \nAdjustment\nGross \nCarrying \nAmount\nAccumulated \nAmortization\nCurrency \nTranslation \nAdjustment\nAmortized intangible\nassets:\nWireless licenses\n21.6\n years\n$\n3,034\n\u00a0\n$\n572\n\u00a0\n$\n23\n\u00a0\n$\n3,045\n\u00a0\n$\n425\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n297\n)\nCustomer lists and \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0relationships\n14.3\n years\n379\n\u00a0\n286\n\u00a0\n(\n74\n)\n413\n\u00a0\n304\n\u00a0\n(\n75\n)\nTrademarks, trade names\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and other\n7.8\n years\n289\n\u00a0\n261\n\u00a0\n(\n5\n)\n330\n\u00a0\n245\n\u00a0\n(\n6\n)\nTotal\n21.4\n years\n$\n3,702\n\u00a0\n$\n1,119\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n56\n)\n$\n3,788\n\u00a0\n$\n974\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n378\n)\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets not subject to amortization:\nWireless licenses\n$\n124,734\n\u00a0\n$\n121,769\n\u00a0\nTrade names\n5,241\n\u00a0\n5,241\n\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n129,975\n\u00a0\n$\n127,010\n\u00a0\nAmortized intangible assets are definite-life assets, and, as such, we record amortization expense based on a method that most appropriately reflects our expected cash flows from these assets.

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nInvestments in partnerships, joint ventures and less than majority-owned subsidiaries in which we have significant influence are accounted for under the equity method.\nOn May 11, 2023, we closed our transaction with BlackRock, through a fund managed by its Diversified Infrastructure business, related to Gigapower, LLC (Gigapower). We deconsolidated Gigapower\u2019s operations and began accounting for it as an equity method investment on May 12, 2023.\nOn July 31, 2021, we closed our transaction with TPG to form a new company named DIRECTV (see Note 6). The transaction resulted in our deconsolidation of the Video business, with DIRECTV being accounted for under the equity method beginning August 1, 2021.\nOur investments in equity affiliates at December\u00a031, 2023, primarily included our interests in DIRECTV, Gigapower and SKY Mexico.\nDIRECTV \nWe account for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method of accounting. DIRECTV is considered a variable interest entity for accounting purposes. As DIRECTV is jointly governed by a board with representation from both AT&T and TPG, with TPG having tie-breaking authority on certain key decisions, most significantly the appointment and removal of the CEO, we have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of DIRECTV.\nThe ownership interests in DIRECTV, based on seniority are as follows:\n\u2022\nPreferred units with distribution rights of $\n1,800\n held by TPG, which were fully distributed in 2021.\n65\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\n\u2022\nJunior preferred units with distribution rights of $\n4,250\n held by AT&T, which were fully distributed as of December 31, 2023.\n\u2022\nDistribution preference associated with Common units of $\n4,200\n held by AT&T, of which $\n2,975\n of distribution rights remain as of December 31, 2023.\n\u2022\nCommon units, with \n70\n% held by AT&T and \n30\n% held by TPG.\nThe initial fair value of the equity considerations on July 31, 2021 was $\n6,852\n, which was determined using a discounted cash flow model reflecting distribution rights and preference of the individual instruments. During 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $\n1,666\n, $\n1,808\n and $\n619\n of equity in net income of affiliates and received total distributions of $\n3,715\n, $\n4,457\n and $\n1,942\n, respectively, from DIRECTV. The book value of our investment in DIRECTV was $\n877\n and $\n2,911\n at December\u00a031, 2023 and 2022. \nOur share of net income or loss may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest of DIRECTV as the terms of the arrangement prescribe substantive non-proportionate cash distributions, both from operations and in liquidation, that are based on classes of interests held by investors.

On April 13, 2022, the BAML Bilateral Term Loan was paid off and terminated.\nIn January 2021, we entered into a $\n14,700\n Term Loan Credit Agreement (2021 Syndicated Term Loan), with Bank of America, N.A., as agent. In March 2021, we borrowed $\n7,350\n under the 2021 Syndicated Term Loan and the remaining $\n7,350\n of lenders\u2019 commitments was terminated. On April 13, 2022, the 2021 Syndicated Term Loan was paid off and terminated. \n68\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nWe currently have a $\n12,000\n revolving credit agreement that terminates on November 18, 2028 (Revolving Credit Agreement), for which we extended the termination date, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, by one year in November 2023. \nNo\n amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December\u00a031, 2023.\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-to-EBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than \n3.75\n-to-1.\nThe events of default are customary for agreements of this type and such events would result in the acceleration of, or would permit the lenders to accelerate, as applicable, required payments and would increase each agreement\u2019s relevant Applicable Margin by \n2.00\n% per annum.\nThe obligations of the lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement to provide advances will terminate on November\u00a018, 2028, unless the commitments are terminated in whole prior to that date. All advances must be repaid no later than the date on which lenders are no longer obligated to make any advances under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement provides that we and lenders representing more than \n50\n% of the facility amount may agree to extend their commitments under the credit agreement for \none\n additional \none-year\n periods beyond the initial termination date. We have the right to terminate, in whole or in part, amounts committed by the lenders under the credit agreement in excess of any outstanding advances; however, any such terminated commitments may not be reinstated.\nAdvances under the Revolving Credit Agreement would bear interest, at our option, either:\n\u2022\nat a variable annual rate equal to: (1) the highest of (but not less than zero) (a) the rate of interest announced publicly by Citibank in New York, New York, from time to time, as Citibank\u2019s base rate, (b) \n0.5\n% per annum above the federal funds rate, and (c) the forward-looking term rate \nbased on the secured overnight financing rate \n(Term SOFR) for a period of one month plus a credit spread adjustment of \n0.10\n% plus \n1.00\n%, plus (2) an applicable margin, as set forth in the credit agreement (the \u201cApplicable Margin for Base Advances\u201d); or\n\u2022\nat a rate equal to: (i) Term SOFR for a period of one, three or six months, as applicable, plus (ii) a credit spread adjustment of \n0.10\n% plus (iii) an applicable margin, as set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cApplicable Margin for Benchmark Rate Advances\u201d).\nWe pay a facility fee of \n0.060\n%, \n0.070\n%, \n0.080\n% or \n0.100\n% per annum of the amount of the lender commitments, depending on AT&T\u2019s credit rating.\nNOTE 12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURE\nThe Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework in ASC 820, \u201cFair Value Measurement,\u201d provides a three-tiered fair value hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.\nThe level of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nThe valuation methodologies described above may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of future net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. We believe our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants. The use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. There have been no changes in the methodologies used since December\u00a031, 2022.\n69\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nLong-Term Debt and Other Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt, including current maturities, and other financial instruments, are summarized as follows:\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nNotes and debentures\n1\n$\n133,402\n\u00a0\n$\n128,474\n\u00a0\n$\n133,207\n\u00a0\n$\n122,524\n\u00a0\nCommercial paper\n2,091\n\u00a0\n2,091\n\u00a0\n866\n\u00a0\n866\n\u00a0\nInvestment securities\n2\n2,836\n\u00a0\n2,836\n\u00a0\n2,692\n\u00a0\n2,692\n\u00a0\n1\nIncludes credit agreement borrowings.\n2\nExcludes investments accounted for under the equity method.\nThe carrying amount of debt with an original maturity of less than one year approximates fair value.

A substantial portion of the fair values of our investment securities is estimated based on quoted market prices. Investments in equity securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued at cost, less any impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable, orderly transactions for identical or similar securities. \n70\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nInvestments in debt securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows.\nThe components comprising total gains and losses in the period on equity securities are as follows:\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2023\n2022\n2021\nTotal gains (losses) recognized on equity securities\n$\n257\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n309\n)\n$\n293\n\u00a0\nGains (Losses) recognized on equity securities sold\n89\n\u00a0\n(\n80\n)\n(\n5\n)\nUnrealized gains (losses) recognized on equity securities held at end of period\n$\n168\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n229\n)\n$\n298\n\u00a0\nAt December\u00a031, 2023, available-for-sale debt securities totaling $\n1,228\n have maturities as follows - less than one year: $\n80\n; one to three years: $\n178\n; three to five years: $\n156\n; five or more years: $\n814\n.\nOur cash equivalents (money market securities), short-term investments (certificate and time deposits) and nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded at amortized cost, and the respective carrying amounts approximate fair values. Short-term investments and nonrefundable customer deposits are recorded in \u201cPrepaid and other current assets\u201d and our investment securities are recorded in \u201cOther Assets\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into derivative transactions to manage certain market risks, primarily interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk. This includes the use of interest rate swaps, interest rate locks, foreign exchange forward contracts and combined interest rate foreign exchange contracts (cross-currency swaps). We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We record derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates (all of our derivatives are Level 2). Cash flows associated with derivative instruments are presented in the same category on the consolidated statements of cash flows as the item being hedged.\nFair Value Hedging \nPeriodically, we enter into and designate fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. The purpose of these swaps is to manage interest rate risk by managing our mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt. These swaps involve the receipt of fixed-rate amounts for floating interest rate payments over the life of the swaps without exchange of the underlying principal amount.\nWe also designate most of our cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange contracts as fair value hedges. The purpose of these contracts is to hedge foreign currency risk associated with changes in spot rates on foreign denominated debt. For cross-currency hedges, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of the swap related to both time value and cross-currency basis spread from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. For foreign exchange contracts, we have elected to exclude the change in fair value of forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\nUnrealized and realized gains or losses from fair value hedges impact the same category on the consolidated statements of income as the item being hedged, including the earnings impact of excluded components. In instances where we have elected to exclude components from the assessment of hedge effectiveness related to fair value hedges, unrealized gains or losses on such excluded components are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI and recognized into earnings over the life of the hedging instrument. Unrealized gains on derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair market value as liabilities. Except for excluded components, changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges are offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities through earnings. In the years ended December\u00a031, 2023 and 2022, no ineffectiveness was measured on fair value hedges.\nCash Flow Hedging \nWe designate some of our cross-currency swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that are attributable to foreign currency risk and interest rate risk generated from our foreign-denominated debt. These agreements include initial and final exchanges of principal from fixed foreign denominated amounts to fixed U.S. dollar denominated amounts, to be exchanged at a specified rate that is usually determined by the market spot rate upon issuance. They also include an interest rate swap of a fixed or floating foreign denominated interest rate to a fixed U.S. dollar denominated interest rate.\nOn September 30, 2022, we de-designated most of our cross-currency swaps from cash flow hedges and re-designated these swaps as fair value hedges. The amount remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to cash flow hedges on the de-designation date was $\n1,857\n. The amount will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged item is recognized in earnings or \n71\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nwhen it becomes probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur. The election of fair value hedge designation for cross-currency swaps does not have an impact on our financial results.\nUnrealized gains on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as assets, and unrealized losses are recorded at fair value as liabilities. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value are reported as a component of accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the consolidated statements of income in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nPeriodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt. Over the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify $\n59\n from accumulated OCI to \u201cInterest expense\u201d due to the amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks.\nCollateral and Credit-Risk Contingency \nWe have entered into agreements with our derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting agreements. At December\u00a031, 2023, we had posted collateral of $\n670\n (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $\n5\n (a receipt liability). Under the agreements, if AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded two ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, one level by S&P and one level by Moody\u2019s, before the final collateral exchange in December, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $\n53\n. If AT&T\u2019s credit rating had been downgraded three ratings levels by Fitch Ratings, two levels by S&P, and two levels by Moody\u2019s, we would have been required to post additional collateral of $\n3,113\n. At December\u00a031, 2022, we had posted collateral of $\n886\n (a deposit asset) and held collateral of $\n0\n (a receipt liability). \nWe do not offset the fair value of collateral, whether the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) exists, against the fair value of the derivative instruments.\nFollowing are the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative positions at December 31:\n2023\n2022\nInterest rate swaps\n$\n1,750\n\u00a0\n$\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nCross-currency swaps\n38,006\n\u00a0\n38,213\n\u00a0\nForeign exchange contracts\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n617\n\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n39,756\n\u00a0\n$\n38,830\n\u00a0\nFollowing are the related hedged items affecting our financial position and performance:\nEffect of Derivatives on the Consolidated Statements of Income\nFair Value Hedging Relationships\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2023\n2022\n2021\nInterest rate swaps (\u201cInterest expense\u201d):\nGain (loss) on interest rate swaps\n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n(\n4\n)\nGain (loss) on long-term debt\n6\n\u00a0\n3\n\u00a0\n4\n\u00a0\nCross-currency swaps:\nGain (loss) on cross-currency swaps\n1,121\n\u00a0\n2,195\n\u00a0\n(\n91\n)\nGain (loss) on long-term debt\n(\n1,121\n)\n(\n2,195\n)\n91\n\u00a0\nGain (loss) recognized in accumulated OCI\n1,126\n\u00a0\n297\n\u00a0\n(\n17\n)\nForeign exchange contracts:\nGain (loss) on foreign exchange contracts\n12\n\u00a0\n(\n12\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nGain (loss) on long-term debt\n(\n12\n)\n12\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nGain (loss) recognized in accumulated OCI\n12\n\u00a0\n(\n12\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n72\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nIn addition, the net swap settlements that accrued and settled in the periods above were offset against \u201cInterest expense.\u201d\nCash Flow Hedging Relationships\nFor the years ended December 31,\n2023\n2022\n2021\nCross-currency swaps:\nGain (loss) recognized in accumulated OCI\n$\n12\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n1,119\n)\n$\n(\n873\n)\nForeign exchange contracts:\nGain (loss) recognized in accumulated OCI\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n3\n\u00a0\n(\n17\n)\nOther income (expense) \u2013 net reclassified from\naccumulated OCI into income\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\nInterest rate locks:\nInterest income (expense) reclassified from\naccumulated OCI into income\n(\n59\n)\n(\n65\n)\n(\n92\n)\nOther income (expense) reclassified from\naccumulated OCI into income\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n(\n45\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nDistribution of WarnerMedia\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n(\n12\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, impairment indicators may subject goodwill and long-lived assets to nonrecurring fair value measurements.

Additionally, we had federal credit carryforwards of $\n485\n and state credit carryforwards of $\n1,582\n, expiring primarily through 2043.\nWe recognize a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our valuation allowances at December\u00a031, 2023 and 2022 related primarily to state and foreign net operating losses and state credit carryforwards.\nWe consider post-1986 unremitted foreign earnings subjected to the one-time transition tax not to be indefinitely reinvested as such earnings can be repatriated without any significant incremental tax costs. We consider other types of unremitted foreign \n73\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nearnings to be indefinitely reinvested. U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have not been recorded on temporary differences related to investments in certain foreign subsidiaries as such differences are considered indefinitely reinvested. The amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability does not have a material impact on the financial statements.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax return position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will ultimately be sustained. For tax positions that meet this recognition threshold, we apply our judgment, taking into account applicable tax laws, our experience in managing tax audits and relevant GAAP, to determine the amount of tax benefits to recognize in our financial statements. For each position, the difference between the benefit realized on our tax return and the benefit reflected in our financial statements is recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as an unrecognized tax benefit (UTB). We update our UTBs at each financial statement date to reflect the impacts of audit settlements and other resolutions of audit issues, the expiration of statutes of limitation, developments in tax law and ongoing discussions with taxing authorities. \nA reconciliation of the change in our UTB balance from January 1 to December 31 for 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\nFederal, State and Foreign Tax\n2023\n2022\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n9,657\n\u00a0\n$\n8,954\n\u00a0\nIncreases for tax positions related to the current year\n1,026\n\u00a0\n1,389\n\u00a0\nIncreases for tax positions related to prior years\n448\n\u00a0\n577\n\u00a0\nDecreases for tax positions related to prior years\n(\n212\n)\n(\n1,079\n)\nLapse of statute of limitations\n(\n16\n)\n(\n2\n)\nSettlements\n1,021\n\u00a0\n(\n182\n)\nBalance at end of year\n11,924\n\u00a0\n9,657\n\u00a0\nAccrued interest and penalties\n1,785\n\u00a0\n1,930\n\u00a0\nGross unrecognized income tax benefits\n13,709\n\u00a0\n11,587\n\u00a0\nLess: Deferred federal and state income tax benefits\n(\n687\n)\n(\n723\n)\nLess: Tax attributable to timing items included above\n(\n6,438\n)\n(\n4,640\n)\nTotal UTB that, if recognized, would impact the\neffective income tax rate as of the end of the year\n$\n6,584\n\u00a0\n$\n6,224\n\u00a0\nPeriodically we make deposits to taxing jurisdictions which reduce our UTB balance but are not included in the reconciliation above. The amount of deposits that reduced our UTB balance was $\n2,361\n at December\u00a031, 2023 and $\n1,767\n at December\u00a031, 2022. Current tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 were $\n2,079\n.\nAccrued interest and penalties included in UTBs were $\n1,785\n as of December\u00a031, 2023 and $\n1,930\n as of December\u00a031, 2022. We record interest and penalties related to federal, state and foreign UTBs in income tax expense. The net interest and penalty expense (benefit) included in income tax expense was $\n324\n for 2023, $(\n86\n) for 2022 and $(\n129\n) for 2021.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As a large taxpayer, our income tax returns are regularly audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities. \nThe IRS has completed field examinations of our tax returns through 2015. All audit periods prior to 2006 are closed for federal examination purposes and we have effectively resolved all outstanding audit issues for years through 2010 with the IRS Appeals Division. Those years will be closed as the final paperwork is processed in the coming months.\nWhile we do not expect material changes, we are generally unable to estimate the range of impacts on the balance of the remaining uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate from the resolution of these issues until each year is closed; and it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\n74\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nThe components of income tax (benefit) expense are as follows:\n2023\n2022\n2021\nFederal:\nCurrent\n$\n2,280\n\u00a0\n$\n579\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n2,400\n)\nDeferred\n2,250\n\u00a0\n2,206\n\u00a0\n6,872\n\u00a0\n4,530\n\u00a0\n2,785\n\u00a0\n4,472\n\u00a0\nState and local:\nCurrent\n423\n\u00a0\n21\n\u00a0\n289\n\u00a0\nDeferred\n(\n832\n)\n912\n\u00a0\n648\n\u00a0\n(\n409\n)\n933\n\u00a0\n937\n\u00a0\nForeign:\nCurrent\n66\n\u00a0\n106\n\u00a0\n(\n66\n)\nDeferred\n38\n\u00a0\n(\n44\n)\n52\n\u00a0\n104\n\u00a0\n62\n\u00a0\n(\n14\n)\nTotal\n$\n4,225\n\u00a0\n$\n3,780\n\u00a0\n$\n5,395\n\u00a0\n\u201cIncome (Loss) from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes\u201d in the consolidated statements of income included the following components for the years ended December 31:\n2023\n2022\n2021\nU.S. income (loss) before income taxes\n$\n20,506\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n1,480\n)\n$\n29,678\n\u00a0\nForeign income (loss) before income taxes\n(\n658\n)\n(\n1,614\n)\n(\n507\n)\nTotal\n$\n19,848\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n3,094\n)\n$\n29,171\n\u00a0\nA reconciliation of income tax expense (benefit) on continuing operations and the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% to income from continuing operations before income taxes is as follows:\n2023\n2022\n2021\nTaxes computed at federal statutory rate\n$\n4,168\n\u00a0\n$\n(\n650\n)\n$\n6,126\n\u00a0\nIncreases (decreases) in income taxes resulting from:\nState and local income taxes \u2013 net of federal income tax benefit\n345\n\u00a0\n795\n\u00a0\n936\n\u00a0\nCARES Act federal NOL carryback\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n(\n471\n)\nTax on foreign investments\n102\n\u00a0\n43\n\u00a0\n47\n\u00a0\nNoncontrolling interest\n(\n259\n)\n(\n308\n)\n(\n291\n)\nPermanent items and R&D credit\n(\n207\n)\n(\n121\n)\n(\n153\n)\nAudit resolutions\n319\n\u00a0\n(\n642\n)\n(\n220\n)\nDivestitures\n(\n75\n)\n(\n481\n)\n(\n558\n)\nGoodwill impairment\n1\n9\n\u00a0\n5,210\n\u00a0\n16\n\u00a0\nOther \u2013 net\n(\n177\n)\n(\n66\n)\n(\n37\n)\nTotal\n$\n4,225\n\u00a0\n$\n3,780\n\u00a0\n$\n5,395\n\u00a0\nEffective Tax Rate\n21.3\n\u00a0\n%\n(\n122.2\n)\n%\n18.5\n\u00a0\n%\n1\n\u00a0\nGoodwill impairments are not deductible for tax purposes. \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was enacted, which allows for a Net Operating Loss (NOL) generated in 2020 to be carried back to a year with a federal rate of 35%.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nWe offer noncontributory pension programs covering the majority of domestic nonmanagement employees in our Communications business. Nonmanagement employees\u2019 pension benefits are generally calculated using one of two formulas: a flat dollar amount applied to years of service according to job classification or a cash balance plan with negotiated annual pension band credits as well as interest credits. Most employees can elect to receive their pension benefits in either a lump sum payment or an annuity.\nPension programs covering U.S. management employees are closed to new entrants. These programs continue to provide benefits to participants that were generally hired before January 1, 2015, who receive benefits under either cash balance pension programs that include annual or monthly credits based on salary as well as interest credits, or a traditional pension formula (i.e., a stated percentage of employees\u2019 adjusted career income).\nWe also provide a variety of medical, dental and life insurance benefits to certain retired employees under various plans and accrue actuarially determined postretirement benefit costs as active employees earn these benefits.\nOn April 26, 2023, AT&T and State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, as independent fiduciary of the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan (Plan), entered into a commitment agreement with subsidiaries of Athene Holding Ltd. (Athene) under which AT&T agreed to purchase nonparticipating single premium group annuity contracts that would transfer to Athene $\n8,067\n of the Plan\u2019s defined benefit pension obligations related to certain retirees, participants and beneficiaries under the Plan.\nThe purchase of the group annuity contracts closed on May 3, 2023, covering approximately \n96,000\n AT&T participants and beneficiaries (Transferred Participants). Under the group annuity contracts, Athene, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Athene Annuity and Life Company and Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company of New York, made an irrevocable commitment, and is solely responsible, to pay the pension benefits of each Transferred Participant beginning with their August 2023 pension payments. The transaction does not change the amount of pension benefits payable to the Transferred Participants.\nThe purchase of the group annuity contracts was funded directly by assets of the Plan via the pension trust underlying the Plan and required \nno\n cash or asset contributions by AT&T. We transferred $\n8,067\n of pension benefit obligation and related plan assets upon close of the transaction and recognized a pre-tax pension settlement gain of $\n363\n. The funded status of the Plan did not materially change due to this transaction.\nThis transaction with Athene was considered a settlement for accounting purposes and required us to remeasure our pension plan assets and obligations at quarter-end for the second and third quarters of 2023. \nDuring the third quarter of 2022, we committed to, and reflected in our results, plan changes impacting postretirement health and welfare benefits. This plan change aligns our benefit plans to market level.\nObligations and Funded Status\nFor defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation, the actuarial present value, as of our December\u00a031 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including estimates of the average life of employees and their beneficiaries and average years of service rendered. It is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels as applicable.\nFor postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, the actuarial present value as of the measurement date of all future benefits attributed under the terms of the postretirement benefit plans to employee service.\n76\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nThe following table presents the change in the projected benefit obligation for the years ended December\u00a031:\nPension Benefits\nPostretirement Benefits\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year\n$\n42,828\n\u00a0\n$\n57,212\n\u00a0\n$\n7,280\n\u00a0\n$\n12,552\n\u00a0\nService cost - benefits earned during the period\n477\n\u00a0\n617\n\u00a0\n23\n\u00a0\n32\n\u00a0\nInterest cost on projected benefit obligation\n1,876\n\u00a0\n1,747\n\u00a0\n340\n\u00a0\n277\n\u00a0\nAmendments\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n(\n42\n)\n(\n2,370\n)\nActuarial (gain) loss\n976\n\u00a0\n(\n10,894\n)\n278\n\u00a0\n(\n1,919\n)\nBenefits paid, including settlements\n(\n4,863\n)\n(\n5,854\n)\n(\n1,186\n)\n(\n1,292\n)\nGroup annuity contract transfer\n(\n8,067\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nBenefit obligation at end of year\n$\n33,227\n\u00a0\n$\n42,828\n\u00a0\n$\n6,693\n\u00a0\n$\n7,280\n\u00a0\nThe following table presents the change in the fair value of plan assets for the years ended December\u00a031 and the plans\u2019 funded status at December\u00a031:\nPension Benefits\nPostretirement Benefits\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n$\n40,874\n\u00a0\n$\n54,401\n\u00a0\n$\n2,160\n\u00a0\n$\n3,198\n\u00a0\nActual return on plan assets\n1,791\n\u00a0\n(\n7,673\n)\n227\n\u00a0\n(\n370\n)\nBenefits paid, including settlements \n1\n(\n4,863\n)\n(\n5,854\n)\n(\n624\n)\n(\n788\n)\nContributions\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n120\n\u00a0\nGroup annuity contract transfer\n(\n7,704\n)\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n30,098\n\u00a0\n40,874\n\u00a0\n1,763\n\u00a0\n2,160\n\u00a0\nUnfunded status at end of year \n2\n$\n(\n3,129\n)\n$\n(\n1,954\n)\n$\n(\n4,930\n)\n$\n(\n5,120\n)\n1\nAt our discretion, certain postretirement benefits may be paid from our cash accounts, which does not reduce Voluntary Employee Benefit Association (VEBA) assets.

A \n0.50\n% increase in the weighted-average interest crediting rate would increase the pension benefit obligation by $\n135\n.\nWe recognize gains and losses on pension and postretirement plan assets and obligations immediately in \u201cOther income (expense) \u2013 net\u201d in our consolidated statements of income. These gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December\u00a031 and accordingly, will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter, unless an earlier remeasurement is required.\n Should actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions, the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future years.\nDiscount Rate \nOur assumed weighted-average discount rates for both pension and postretirement benefits of \n5.00\n%, at December\u00a031, 2023, reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participants. We determined our discount rate based on a range of factors, including a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected durations of future cash outflows. These bonds had an average rating of at least Aa3 or AA- by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, denominated in U.S. dollars, and generally not callable, convertible or index linked. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2023, when compared to the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, we decreased our pension discount rate by \n0.20\n%, resulting in an increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of $\n916\n and decreased our postretirement discount rate by \n0.20\n%, resulting in an increase in our postretirement benefit obligation of $\n110\n. For the year ended December\u00a031, 2022, we increased our pension discount rate by \n2.20\n%, resulting in a decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of $\n11,738\n and increased our postretirement discount rate by \n2.40\n%, resulting in a decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of $\n2,102\n.\nWe utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest components of net periodic benefit costs for pension and other postretirement benefits. Under this approach, we apply discounting using individual spot rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. These spot rates align to each of the projected benefit obligations and service cost cash flows. The service cost component relates to the active participants in the plan, so the relevant cash flows on which to apply the yield curve are considerably longer in duration on average than the total projected benefit obligation cash flows, which also include benefit payments to retirees. Interest cost is computed by multiplying each spot rate by the corresponding discounted projected benefit obligation cash flows. The full yield curve approach reduces any actuarial gains and losses based upon interest rate expectations (e.g., built-in gains in interest cost in an upward sloping yield curve scenario), or gains and losses merely resulting from the timing and magnitude of cash outflows associated with our benefit obligations. Neither the annual measurement of our total benefit obligations nor annual net benefit cost is affected by the full yield curve approach.\n79\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nExpected Long-Term Rate of Return \nIn 2024, our expected long-term rate of return is \n7.75\n% on pension plan assets and \n4.00\n% on postretirement plan assets, an increase of \n0.25\n% for pension plan assets and a decrease of \n2.50\n% for postretirement plan assets. This update to our asset return assumptions was due to economic forecasts and changes in the asset mix. Our long-term rates of return reflect the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. In setting the long-term assumed rate of return, management considers capital markets\u2019 future expectations, the asset mix of the plans\u2019 investment and average historical asset return. Actual long-term returns can, in relatively stable markets, also serve as a factor in determining future expectations. We consider many factors that include, but are not limited to, historical returns on plan assets, current market information on long-term returns (e.g., long-term bond rates) and current and target asset allocations between asset categories. The target asset allocation is determined based on consultations with external investment advisers. If all other factors were to remain unchanged, we expect that a \n0.50\n% decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would cause 2024 combined pension and postretirement cost to increase $\n150\n. However, any differences in the rate and actual returns will be included with the actuarial gain or loss recorded in the fourth quarter when our plans are remeasured.\nComposite Rate of Compensation Increase \nOur expected composite rate of compensation increase cost of \n3.00\n% in 2023 and 2022 reflects the long-term average rate of salary increases.\nHealthcare Cost Trend \nOur healthcare cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Based on our assessment of expectations of healthcare industry inflation, our 2024 assumed annual healthcare prescription drug cost trend and medical cost trend for eligible participants will remain at an annual and ultimate trend rate of \n4.50\n%. For 2023, our assumed annual healthcare prescription drug cost trend and medical cost trend for eligible participants increased from an annual and ultimate trend rate of \n4.25\n% to an annual and ultimate trend rate of \n4.50\n%. This change in assumption increased our obligation by $\n19\n.\nPlan Assets\nPlan assets consist primarily of private and public equity, government and corporate bonds, and real assets (real estate and natural resources). The asset allocations of the pension plans are maintained to meet ERISA requirements. Any plan contributions, as determined by ERISA regulations, are made to a pension trust for the benefit of plan participants. We do not have significant ERISA required contributions to our pension plans for 2024.\nWe maintain VEBA trusts to partially fund postretirement benefits; however, there are no ERISA or regulatory requirements that these postretirement benefit plans be funded annually. We made discretionary contributions of $\n120\n in December 2022 to our postretirement plan.\nThe principal investment objectives are to ensure the availability of funds to pay pension and postretirement benefits as they become due under a broad range of future economic scenarios, maximize long-term investment return with an acceptable level of risk based on our pension and postretirement obligations, and diversify broadly across and within the capital markets to insulate asset values against adverse experience in any one market. Each asset class has broadly diversified characteristics. Substantial biases toward any particular investing style or type of security are sought to be avoided by managing the aggregation of all accounts with portfolio benchmarks. Asset and benefit obligation forecasting studies are conducted periodically, generally every two to three years, or when significant changes have occurred in market conditions, benefits, participant demographics or funded status. Decisions regarding investment policy are made with an understanding of the effect of asset allocation on funded status, future contributions and projected expenses.\nThe plans\u2019 weighted-average asset targets and actual allocations as a percentage of plan assets, including the notional exposure of future contracts by asset categories at December\u00a031 are as follows:\nPension Assets\nPostretirement (VEBA) Assets\nTarget\n2023\n2022\nTarget\n2023\n2022\nEquity securities:\nDomestic\n2\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n22\n\u00a0\n%\n10\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n7\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n11\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n21\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n16\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n21\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\nInternational\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n19\n\u00a0\n%\n7\n\u00a0\n4\n\u00a0\n6\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n16\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n11\n\u00a0\n21\n\u00a0\nFixed income securities\n34\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n54\n\u00a0\n%\n47\n\u00a0\n45\n\u00a0\n3\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n13\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n8\n\u00a0\n47\n\u00a0\nReal assets\n9\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n29\n\u00a0\n%\n16\n\u00a0\n16\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n6\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n1\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\nPrivate equity\n6\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n26\n\u00a0\n%\n20\n\u00a0\n14\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n6\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n1\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\nPreferred interests\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n13\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nOther\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n5\n\u00a0\n%\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n1\n\u00a0\n59\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n-\n69\n\u00a0\n\u00a0%\n63\n\u00a0\n9\n\u00a0\nTotal\n100\n\u00a0\n%\n100\n\u00a0\n%\n100\n\u00a0\n%\n100\n\u00a0\n%\n80\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nPrior to April 2023, the pension trust held preferred equity interests in AT&T Mobility II LLC (Mobility II), the primary holding company for our wireless business.

(See Note 16) \nAt December\u00a031, 2023, AT&T securities represented less than 1% of assets held by our pension trust. The VEBA trusts do not hold AT&T securities. \nInvestment Valuation\nInvestments are stated at fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date.\nInvestments in securities traded on a national securities exchange are valued at the last reported sales price on the final business day of the year. If no sale was reported on that date, they are valued at the last reported bid price. Investments in securities not traded on a national securities exchange are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. Shares of registered investment companies are valued based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value of shares held at year-end.\nOther commingled investment entities are valued at quoted redemption values that represent the net asset values of units held at year-end which management has determined approximates fair value.\nReal estate and natural resource direct investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports. Fixed income securities valuation is based upon observable prices for comparable assets, broker/dealer quotes (spreads or prices), or a pricing matrix that derives spreads for each bond based on external market data, including the current credit rating for the bonds, credit spreads to Treasuries for each credit rating, sector add-ons or credits, issue-specific add-ons or credits as well as call or other options.\nPrior to redemption, the preferred interests in Mobility II were valued by an independent fiduciary using an income approach.\nPurchases and sales of securities are recorded as of the trade date. Realized gains and losses on sales of securities are determined on the basis of average cost. Interest income is recognized on the accrual basis. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date.\nNon-interest bearing cash and overdrafts are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.\nFair Value Measurements\nSee Note 12 for a

Because benefit payments will depend on future employment and compensation levels; average years employed; average life spans; and payment elections, among other factors, changes in any of these assumptions could significantly affect these expected amounts. \nThe following table provides expected benefit payments under our pension and postretirement plans:\nPension Benefits\nPostretirement Benefits\n2024\n$\n3,185\n\u00a0\n$\n788\n\u00a0\n2025\n2,907\n\u00a0\n664\n\u00a0\n2026\n2,841\n\u00a0\n622\n\u00a0\n2027\n2,826\n\u00a0\n588\n\u00a0\n2028\n2,803\n\u00a0\n564\n\u00a0\nYears 2029 - 2033\n13,340\n\u00a0\n2,252\n\u00a0\nSupplemental Retirement Plans\nWe also provide certain senior- and middle-management employees with nonqualified, unfunded supplemental retirement and savings plans. While these plans are unfunded, we have assets in a designated non-bankruptcy remote trust that are independently managed and used to provide for certain of these benefits. These plans include supplemental pension benefits as well as compensation-deferral plans, some of which include a corresponding match by us based on a percentage of the compensation deferral. For our supplemental retirement plans, the projected benefit obligation was $\n1,437\n and the net supplemental retirement pension cost was $\n87\n at and for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023. The projected benefit obligation was $\n1,544\n and the net supplemental retirement pension credit was $\n234\n at and for the year ended December\u00a031, 2022.\nWe use the same significant assumptions for the composite rate of compensation increase in determining our projected benefit obligation and the net pension and postemployment benefit cost. Our discount rates of \n4.90\n% at December\u00a031, 2023 and \n5.10\n% at December\u00a031, 2022 were calculated using the same methodologies used in calculating the discount rates for our qualified pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nDeferred compensation expense was $\n101\n in 2023, $\n94\n in 2022 and $\n171\n in 2021.\n84\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nContributory Savings Plans\nWe maintain contributory savings plans that cover substantially all employees. Under the savings plans, we match in cash or company stock a stated percentage of eligible employee contributions, subject to a specified ceiling. There are \nno\n debt-financed shares held by the Employee Stock Ownership Plans, allocated or unallocated.\nOur match of employee contributions to the savings plans is fulfilled with purchases of our stock on the open market or company cash. Benefit cost, which is based on the cost of shares or units allocated to participating employees\u2019 accounts or the cash contributed to participant accounts, was $\n570\n, $\n611\n and $\n614\n for the years ended December\u00a031, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nNOTE 15. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\nUnder our various plans, senior and other management employees and nonemployee directors have received nonvested stock and stock units. The shares will vest over a period of \none\n to \nfour years\n in accordance with the terms of those plans.\nWe grant performance stock units, which are nonvested stock units, based upon our stock price at the date of grant and award them in the form of AT&T common stock and cash at the end of a \nthree\n-year period, subject to the achievement of certain performance goals. We treat the cash settled portion of these awards as a liability. Effective with the 2021 plan year, for the majority of employees, performance shares were replaced with restricted stock units that do not have any performance conditions. These new restricted stock units vest ratably over a three-year period. We grant forfeitable restricted stock and stock units, which are valued at the market price of our common stock at the date of grant and predominantly vest over a \nthree\n- to \nfive\n-year period. We also grant other nonvested stock units and award them in cash at the end of a \nthree\n-year period, subject to the achievement of certain market-based conditions. As of December\u00a031, 2023, we were authorized to issue up to approximately \n123\n million shares of common stock (in addition to shares that may be issued upon exercise of outstanding options or upon vesting of performance stock units or other nonvested stock units) to officers, employees and directors pursuant to these various plans.\nWe account for our share-based payment arrangements based on the fair value of the awards on their respective grant date, which may affect our ability to fully realize the value shown on our consolidated balance sheets of deferred tax assets associated with compensation expense. We record a valuation allowance when our future taxable income is not expected to be sufficient to recover the asset. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the current stock price of our common shares will rise to levels sufficient to realize the entire tax benefit currently reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. However, to the extent we generate excess tax benefits (i.e., those additional tax benefits in excess of the deferred taxes associated with compensation expense previously recognized) the potential future impact on income would be reduced.\nOur consolidated statements of income include the compensation cost recognized for those plans as operating expenses, as well as the associated tax benefits, which are reflected in the table below:\n2023\n2022\n2021\nPerformance stock units\n$\n79\n\u00a0\n$\n168\n\u00a0\n$\n248\n\u00a0\nRestricted stock and stock units\n400\n\u00a0\n350\n\u00a0\n199\n\u00a0\nOther nonvested stock units\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nStock options\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u00a0\nTotal\n$\n479\n\u00a0\n$\n518\n\u00a0\n$\n447\n\u00a0\nIncome tax benefit\n$\n118\n\u00a0\n$\n127\n\u00a0\n$\n110\n\u00a0\n85\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nA summary of the status of our nonvested stock units as of December\u00a031, 2023, and changes during the year then ended is presented as follows (shares in millions):\nNonvested Stock Units\nShares\nWeighted-Average Grant-\nDate Fair Value\nNonvested at January 1, 2023\n36\n\u00a0\n$\n22.07\n\u00a0\nGranted\n22\n\u00a0\n19.24\n\u00a0\nVested\n(\n27\n)\n22.05\n\u00a0\nForfeited\n(\n3\n)\n20.05\n\u00a0\nNonvested at December\u00a031, 2023\n28\n\u00a0\n$\n20.05\n\u00a0\nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, there was $\n445\n of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based payment arrangements granted. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n1.76\n years. The total fair value of shares vested during the year was $\n592\n for 2023, compared to $\n783\n for 2022 and $\n608\n for 2021.\nIt is our intent to satisfy share option exercises using our treasury stock. Cash received from stock option exercises was $\n1\n for 2023, $\n2\n for 2022 and $\n11\n for 2021.\nNOTE 16. STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 AND MEZZANINE EQUITY\nAuthorized Shares \nWe have authorized \n14\n billion common shares of AT&T stock and \n10\n million preferred shares of AT&T stock, each with a par value of $\n1.00\n per share. Cumulative perpetual preferred shares consist of the following:\n\u2022\nSeries A:  \n48\n thousand shares outstanding at December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, with a $\n25,000\n per share liquidation preference and a dividend rate of \n5.000\n%.\n\u2022\nSeries B:  \n20\n thousand shares outstanding at December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, with a \u20ac\n100,000\n per share liquidation preference, and an initial rate of \n2.875\n%, subject to reset after May 1, 2025.\n\u2022\nSeries C:  \n70\n thousand shares outstanding at December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, with a $\n25,000\n per share liquidation preference, and a dividend rate of \n4.75\n%.\nSo long as the quarterly preferred dividends are declared and paid on a timely basis on each series of preferred shares, there are no limitations on our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T common shares. The preferred shares are optionally redeemable by AT&T at the liquidation price on or after \nfive years\n from the issuance date, or upon certain other contingent events. \nStock Repurchase Program \nFrom time to time, we repurchase shares of common stock for distribution through our employee benefit plans or in connection with certain acquisitions. In March 2014, our Board of Directors approved an authorization program to repurchase \n300\n million shares of common stock, of which approximately \n144\n million remain outstanding at December\u00a031, 2023.\nTo implement these authorizations, we used open market repurchases, relying on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where feasible. We also used accelerated share repurchase agreements with large financial institutions to repurchase our stock. During 2023, there were \nno\n shares repurchased and during 2022, we repurchased approximately \n34\n\u00a0million shares totaling $\n662\n under the March 2014 authorization.\nDividend Declarations \nIn December 2023 and December 2022, AT&T declared a quarterly preferred dividend of $\n36\n. In December 2023 and December 2022, AT&T declared a quarterly common dividend of $\n0.2775\n per share of common stock.\nPreferred Interests Issued by Subsidiaries \nWe have issued cumulative perpetual preferred membership interests in certain subsidiaries. The preferred interests are entitled to cash distributions, subject to declaration.\nMobility II Preferred Interests \nIn 2018, we issued \n320\n million Series A Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II (Mobility preferred interests), which paid cash distributions of \n7\n% per annum, subject to declaration. So long as the distributions were declared and paid, the terms of the Mobility preferred interests did not impose any limitations on cash movements between \n86\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\naffiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares. All outstanding Mobility preferred interests were repurchased as of April 2023, leaving \nno\n amounts outstanding at December 31, 2023.\nPrior to repurchase, a holder of the Mobility preferred interests could put the interests to Mobility II, or Mobility II could have redeemed the interests upon a change in control of Mobility II or on or after September 9, 2022, with either option only allowed to be exercised during certain periods. \nThe price at which a put option or a redemption option could be exercised was the greater of (1) the market value of the interests as of the last date of the quarter preceding the date of the exercise of a put or redemption option and (2) the sum of (a) \ntwenty-five\n dollars plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price was to be paid with cash, AT&T common stock, or a combination of cash and AT&T common stock, at Mobility II\u2019s sole election. In no event was Mobility II required to deliver more than \n250\n\u00a0million shares of AT&T common stock to settle put and redemption options.\nO\nn October 24, 2022, approximately \n105\n\u00a0million Mobility preferred interests were put to AT&T by a third-party investor, for which we paid approximately $\n2,600\n cash to redeem. On December 27, 2022, the AT&T pension trust provided written notice of its right to require us to purchase the remaining \n213\n\u00a0million, or approximately $\n5,340\n, of Mobility preferred interests outstanding. The terms of the instruments limited the amount we were required to redeem in any 12-month period to approximately \n107\n\u00a0million shares, or $\n2,670\n. With the certainty of redemption, the Mobility preferred interests were reclassified from equity to a liability at fair value, with approximately $\n2,670\n recorded in current liabilities as \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities,\u201d representing the amount required to be redeemed within one year, and $\n2,670\n recorded in \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities.\u201d The liabilities associated with the Mobility preferred interests were considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Notes 12 and 14). The difference between the carrying value of the Mobility preferred interest, which represented fair value at contribution, and the fair value of the instrument upon settlement and/or balance sheet reclassification was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately \n213\n\u00a0million Mobility preferred interests outstanding, which had a redemption value of approximately $\n5,340\n and paid cash distributions of $\n373\n per annum, subject to declaration. In April 2023, we accepted the December 2022 put option notice from the AT&T pension trust and repurchased the remaining \n213\n\u00a0million Mobility preferred interest for a purchase price, including accrued and unpaid distributions, of $\n5,414\n.\nTower Holdings Preferred Interests\nIn 2019, we issued $\n6,000\n nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests in a wireless subsidiary (Tower Holdings) that holds interests in various tower assets and have the right to receive approximately $\n6,000\n if the purchase options from the tower companies are exercised.\nThe membership interests in Tower Holdings consist of (1) common interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&T, and (2) two series of preferred interests (collectively the \u201cTower preferred interests\u201d). The September series (Tower Class A-1) of the preferred interests totals $\n1,500\n and pays an initial preferred distribution of \n5.0\n%, and the December series (Tower Class A-2) totals $\n4,500\n and pays an initial preferred distribution of \n4.75\n%. Distributions are paid quarterly, subject to declaration, and reset every \nfive years\n. Any failure to declare or pay distributions on the Tower preferred interests would not impose any limitation on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares. We can call the Tower preferred interests at the issue price beginning \nfive years\n from the issuance date or upon the receipt of proceeds from the sale of the underlying assets. The Tower preferred interests are included in \u201cNoncontrolling interest\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. \nThe holders of the Tower preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of AT&T to pay the preferred distribution for \ntwo\n or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given upon such an event, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of membership interests in Tower Holdings are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\nTelco LLC Preferred Interests\nIn September 2020, we issued $\n2,000\n nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-1) out of a newly created limited liability company (Telco LLC) that was formed to hold telecommunication-related assets. In April 2023, we expanded our September 2020 transaction and issued an additional $\n5,250\n of nonconvertible cumulative preferred interests (Telco Class A-2 and A-3). As of December 31, 2023, cumulative preferred interests in our Telco LLC totaled $\n7,250\n (collectively the \u201cTelco preferred interests\u201d).\nMembers\u2019 equity in Telco LLC consist of (1) member\u2019s interests, which are held by a consolidated subsidiary of AT&T, (2) Telco Class A-1 preferred interests, which pay an initial preferred distribution of \n4.25\n% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset every \nseven years\n, and (3) Telco Class A-2 and A-3 preferred interest which pay an initial preferred distribution \n87\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nof \n6.85\n% annually, subject to declaration, and subject to reset on November 1, 2027 and every \nseven years\n thereafter. Failure to pay distributions on the Telco preferred interests would not limit cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares. We can call the Telco preferred interests at the issue price beginning \nseven years\n from the issuance date. The Telco preferred interests are included in \u201cNoncontrolling interest\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe holders of the Telco preferred interests have the option to require redemption upon the occurrence of certain contingent events, such as the failure of Telco LLC to pay the preferred distribution for \ntwo\n or more periods or to meet certain other requirements, including a minimum credit rating. If notice is given, all other holders of equal or more subordinate classes of members\u2019 equity are entitled to receive the same form of consideration payable to the holders of the preferred interests, resulting in a deemed liquidation for accounting purposes.\nMobility II Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nIn June 2023, we issued \ntwo million\n\u00a0 Series B Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Membership Interests in Mobility II LLC (Mobility noncontrolling interests), which pay cash distributions of \n6.8\n% per annum, subject to declaration. So long as the distributions are declared and paid, the terms of the Mobility noncontrolling interests will not impose any limitations on cash movements between affiliates, or our ability to declare a dividend on or repurchase AT&T shares.\nThe Mobility noncontrolling interests are required to be initially recorded at fair value less issuance costs and will accrete to redemption value of $\n2,000\n through \u201cNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest.\u201d The Mobility noncontrolling interests are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures framework (see Note 12) and included in \u201cRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. \nA holder of the Mobility noncontrolling interests may put the interests to Mobility II on or after the earliest of certain events or each June 15 and December 15, beginning on June 15, 2028. Mobility II may redeem the interests on each March 15 and September 15, beginning on March 15, 2028. The price at which a put option or a redemption option can be exercised is the sum of (a) $\n1,000\n per Mobility noncontrolling interest plus (b) any accrued and unpaid distributions. The redemption price must be paid in cash.\n \nNOTE 17. SALES OF RECEIVABLES\nWe have agreements with various third-party financial institutions pertaining to the sales of certain types of our accounts receivable. The most significant of these programs consists of receivables arising from equipment installment plans, which are sold for cash and beneficial interests, such as deferred purchase price, when applicable. Under the terms of our agreement for this program, we continue to service the transferred receivables on behalf of the financial institutions.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of cash proceeds received, net of remittances paid, from sales of receivables for the years ended December 31:\n2023\n2022\n2021\nNet cash received from equipment installment receivables\n1\n$\n648\n\u00a0\n$\n1,875\n\u00a0\n$\n1,000\n\u00a0\nNet cash received (paid) from other programs\n2\n824\n\u00a0\n620\n\u00a0\n(\n295\n)\nTotal net cash impact to cash flows from operating activities\n$\n1,472\n\u00a0\n$\n2,495\n\u00a0\n$\n705\n\u00a0\n1\nCash from initial sales of $\n10,980\n, $\n11,129\n and $\n9,740\n for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n2\nCertain transferred receivables are guaranteed by a subsidiary that holds additional receivables in the amount of $\n924\n at December\u00a031, 2023, which are pledged as collateral and represent our maximum exposure to loss.\nThe sales of receivables did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of income or to \u201cTotal Assets\u201d reported on our consolidated balance sheets. We reflect cash receipts on sold receivables as cash flows from operations in our consolidated statements of cash flows. In the event cash is received on the beneficial interests, those receipts are classified as cash flows from investing activities, when applicable.\n88\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the equipment installment receivables and accounts being serviced at December 31:\n2023\n2022\nGross receivables:\n$\n3,714\n\u00a0\n$\n4,165\n\u00a0\nBalance sheet classification\nAccounts receivable\nNotes receivable\n1,695\n\u00a0\n1,789\n\u00a0\nTrade receivables\n548\n\u00a0\n522\n\u00a0\nOther Assets\nNoncurrent notes and trade receivables\n1,471\n\u00a0\n1,854\n\u00a0\nOutstanding portfolio of receivables derecognized from\nour consolidated balance sheets\n$\n12,027\n\u00a0\n$\n11,030\n\u00a0\nCash proceeds received, net of remittances\n1\n9,361\n\u00a0\n8,519\n\u00a0\n1\nRepresents amounts to which financial institutions remain entitled, excluding the beneficial interests.\nWe offer our customers the option to purchase certain wireless devices in installments over a specified period of time and, in many cases, once certain conditions are met, they may be eligible to trade in the original equipment for a new device and have the remaining unpaid balance paid or settled.\nWe maintain a program under which we transfer a portion of these receivables through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiary in exchange for cash and beneficial interests. In the event a customer trades in a device prior to the end of the installment contract period, we agree to make a payment to the financial institutions equal to any outstanding remaining installment receivable balance. Accordingly, we record a guarantee obligation for this estimated amount at the time the receivables are transferred.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of equipment installment receivables sold under this program:\n2023\n2022\n2021\nGross receivables sold\n1\n$\n11,104\n\u00a0\n$\n11,510\n\u00a0\n$\n10,793\n\u00a0\nNet receivables sold\n2\n10,603\n\u00a0\n11,061\n\u00a0\n10,502\n\u00a0\nCash proceeds received\n10,980\n\u00a0\n11,129\n\u00a0\n9,740\n\u00a0\nBeneficial interests recorded\n\u2014\n\u00a0\n245\n\u00a0\n1,080\n\u00a0\nGuarantee obligation recorded\n932\n\u00a0\n703\n\u00a0\n434\n\u00a0\n1\nReceivables net of promotion credits.\n2\nReceivables net of allowance, imputed interest and equipment trade-in right guarantees.\nBeneficial interests and guarantee obligation are initially recorded at estimated fair value and subsequently adjusted for changes in present value of expected cash flows. The estimation of their fair values is based on remaining installment payments expected to be collected and the expected timing and value of device trade-ins. The estimated value of the device trade-ins considers prices offered to us by independent third parties and contemplates changes in value after the launch of a device model. The fair value measurements used for the beneficial interests and the guarantee obligation are considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 12).\nThe following table presents the previously transferred equipment installment receivables, which we repurchased in exchange for the associated beneficial interests:\n2023\n2022\n2021\nFair value of repurchased receivables\n$\n2,997\n\u00a0\n$\n3,314\n\u00a0\n$\n1,424\n\u00a0\nCarrying value of beneficial interests\n3,013\n\u00a0\n3,335\n\u00a0\n1,334\n\u00a0\nGain (loss) on repurchases\n1\n$\n(\n16\n)\n$\n(\n21\n)\n$\n90\n\u00a0\n1\nThese gains (losses) are included in \u201cSelling, general and administrative\u201d expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nAt December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, our beneficial interests were $\n2,270\n and $\n2,318\n, respectively, of which $\n1,296\n and $\n1,278\n are included in \u201cPrepaid and other current assets\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in \u201cOther Assets.\u201d The guarantee obligation at December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022 was $\n385\n and $\n419\n, respectively, of which $\n111\n and $\n73\n are included in \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder \n89\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nin \u201cOther noncurrent liabilities.\u201d Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of selling these equipment installment receivables is limited to the total amount of our beneficial interests and guarantee obligation.\nNOTE 18. TOWER TRANSACTION\nIn December 2013, we closed our transaction with Crown Castle International Corp. (Crown Castle) in which Crown Castle gained the exclusive rights to lease and operate \n9,048\n wireless towers and purchased \n627\n of our wireless towers for $\n4,827\n in cash. The leases have various terms with an average length of approximately \n28\n years. As the leases expire, Crown Castle will have fixed price purchase options for these towers totaling approximately $\n4,200\n, based on their estimated fair market values at the end of the lease terms. We sublease space on the towers from Crown Castle for an initial term of \nten years\n, as renewed, at current market rates, subject to further optional renewals in the future.\nWe determined that we did not transfer control of the tower assets, which prevented us from achieving sale-leaseback accounting for the transaction, and we accounted for the cash proceeds from Crown Castle as a financing obligation on our consolidated balance sheets. We record interest on the financing obligation using the effective interest method at a rate of approximately \n3.9\n%. The financing obligation is increased by interest expense and estimated future net cash flows generated and retained by Crown Castle from operation of the tower sites, and reduced by our contractual payments. We continue to include the tower assets in \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment \u2013 Net\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them accordingly. At December\u00a031, 2023 and 2022, the tower assets had a balance of $\n647\n and $\n686\n, respectively. Our depreciation expense for these assets was $\n39\n for each of 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nPayments made to Crown Castle under this arrangement were $\n264\n for 2023. At December\u00a031, 2023, the future minimum payments under the sublease arrangement are $\n269\n for 2024, $\n274\n for 2025, $\n280\n for 2026, $\n285\n for 2027, $\n291\n for 2028 and $\n1,686\n thereafter.\nNOTE 19. TRANSACTIONS WITH DIRECTV\nWe account for our investment in DIRECTV under the equity method and record our share of DIRECTV earnings as equity in net income of affiliates, with DIRECTV considered a related party. (See Note 10)\nAt December 31, 2023, our investment in DIRECTV was \n$\n877\n. \nThe following table sets forth o\nur share of DIRECTV\u2019s earnings included in equity in net income of affiliates and cash distributions received from DIRECTV as of December 31: \n2023\n2022\n2021\nDIRECTV\u2019s earnings included in equity in net income of affiliates\n$\n1,666\n\u00a0\n$\n1,808\n\u00a0\n$\n619\n\u00a0\nDistributions classified as operating activities\n$\n1,666\n\u00a0\n$\n1,808\n\u00a0\n$\n619\n\u00a0\nDistributions classified as investing activities\n2,049\n\u00a0\n2,649\n\u00a0\n1,323\n\u00a0\nCash distributions received from DIRECTV\n$\n3,715\n\u00a0\n$\n4,457\n\u00a0\n$\n1,942\n\u00a0\nIn 2021, in addition to the assets and liabilities contributed to DIRECTV, we recorded total obligations of $\n2,100\n to cover certain net losses under the NFL SUNDAY TICKET contract, of which $\n1,800\n was in the form of a note payable to DIRECTV. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, cash payments to DIRECTV on the note totaled $\n130\n and $\n1,211\n, respectively and were classified as financing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. As of December 31, 2023 the notes to DIRECTV have been repaid. \nWe provide DIRECTV with network transport for U-verse products and sales services under commercial arrangements for up to \nfive years\n. Under separate transition services agreements, we provide DIRECTV certain operational support, including servicing of certain customer receivables. \nFor the years ended December\u00a031, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we billed DIRECTV approximately $\n730\n, $\n1,260\n and $\n550\n for these costs, which were recorded as a reduction to the operations and support expenses incurred.\nAt December\u00a031, 2023, we had accounts receivable from DIRECTV of $\n280\n and accounts payable to DIRECTV of $\n30\n.\nWe are not committed, implicitly or explicitly, to provide financial or other support, as our involvement with DIRECTV is limited to the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities recognized on our balance sheet.\n90\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nNOTE 20. FIRSTNET\nIn 2017, the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) selected AT&T to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America\u2019s first responders. Under the \n25\n-year agreement, FirstNet provides 20 MHz of valuable telecommunications spectrum and success-based payments of $\n6,500\n to support network buildout, which has been substantially completed. We are required to construct a network that achieves coverage and nationwide interoperability requirements and have a contractual commitment to make sustainability payments of $\n18,000\n over the \n25\n-year contract. These sustainability payments represent our commitment to fund FirstNet\u2019s operating expenses and future reinvestments in the network which we own and operate, which we estimate in the $\n3,000\n or less range over the life of the \n25\n-year contract. After FirstNet\u2019s operating expenses are paid, we anticipate the remaining amount, expected to be in the $\n15,000\n range, will be reinvested into the network. On January 30, 2024, FirstNet agreed to reinvest up to $\n6,300\n in the network over the next \n10\n years, subject to authorization. \nDuring 2023, we submitted $\n195\n in sustainability payments, with future payments under the agreement of $\n561\n for 2024, $\n420\n for 2025; $\n896\n for 2026, $\n1,566\n for 2027, $\n1,658\n for 2028; and $\n11,909\n thereafter. Amounts paid to FirstNet, which are not expected to be returned to AT&T to be reinvested into our network, will be expensed in the period paid. In the event FirstNet does not reinvest any funds to construct, operate, improve and maintain this network, our maximum exposure to loss is the total amount of the sustainability payments, which would be reflected in higher expense.\nThe $\n6,500\n of initial funding from FirstNet is contingent on the achievement of \nsix\n operating capability milestones and certain first responder subscriber adoption targets. These milestones are based on coverage objectives of the first responder network during the construction period, which is expected to be over \nfive years\n, and subscriber adoption targets. Funding payments received from FirstNet are reflected as a reduction from the costs capitalized in the construction of the network and, as appropriate, a reduction of associated operating expenses. As of December\u00a031, 2023, we have collected $\n6,404\n of the $\n6,500\n for the completion of certain tasks.\nNOTE 21. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n \nWe are party to numerous lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In evaluating these matters on an ongoing basis, we take into account amounts already accrued on the balance sheet. In our opinion, although the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, they should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have contractual obligations to purchase certain goods or services from various other parties. Our purchase obligations are expected to be approximately $\n7,555\n in 2024, $\n12,856\n in total for 2025 and 2026, $\n8,187\n in total for 2027 and 2028 and $\n909\n in total for years thereafter.\nSee Note 12 for a discussion of collateral and credit-risk contingencies.\nNOTE 22. SUPPLIER AND VENDOR FINANCING PROGRAMS\nSupplier Financing Program\nWe actively manage the timing of our supplier payments for operating items to optimize the use of our cash and seek to make payments on 90-day or greater terms, while providing suppliers with access to bank facilities that permit earlier payment at their cost. Our supplier financing program does not result in changes to our normal, contracted payment cycles or cash from operations. \nAt the supplier\u2019s election, they can receive payment of AT&T obligations prior to the scheduled due dates, at a discounted price from the third-party financial institution. The discounted price paid by participating suppliers is based on a variable rate that is indexed to the overnight borrowing rate. We agree to pay the financial institution the stated amount generally within 90 days of receipt of the invoice. We do not have pledged assets or other guarantees under our supplier financing program. \nOur outstanding payment obligations are included in \u201cAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets and are reported as operating or investing (when capitalizable) activities in our statements of cash flows when paid. \n91\nAT&T Inc.\nDollars in millions except per share amounts\nThe following table presents the change in the supplier financing obligation for the year ended December 31:\n2023\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the beginning of year\n$\n2,869\n\u00a0\nInvoices received\n12,496\n\u00a0\nInvoices paid\n(\n12,521\n)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the end of year\n$\n2,844\n\u00a0\nDirect Supplier Financing\nWe also have arrangements with suppliers of handset inventory that allow us to extend the stated payment terms by up to 90 days at an additional cost to us (variable rate extension fee).
