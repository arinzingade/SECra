Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cbelieve\u201d and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. These forward-looking statements are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions and speak only as of the date on which it is made. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements we make regarding future attendance levels, operating revenues and our liquidity. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors, including those discussed in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe risks and uncertainties relating to the sufficiency of our existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity, including following maturity of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8\u2014Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof), to fund operations, and satisfy obligations including cash outflows for deferred rent and planned capital expenditures currently and through the next twelve months. In order to achieve net positive operating cash flows and long-term profitability, operating revenues will need to increase from current levels to levels in line with pre-COVID-19 operating revenues. However, there remain significant risks that may negatively impact operating revenues and attendance levels, including changes to movie studios release schedules (including as a result of production delays and delays to the release of movies caused by labor stoppages, including but not limited to the Writers Guild of America strike and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strike that occurred during 2023) and direct to streaming or other changing movie studio practices. If we are unable to achieve increased levels of attendance and operating revenues, we expect we will be required to obtain additional liquidity. If such additional liquidity is not obtained or insufficient, we likely would seek an in-court or out-of-court restructuring of our liabilities, and in the event of such future liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, holders of our Class A common stock (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d) and other securities would likely suffer a total loss of their investment; \n\u200b\n\u25cf\nchanging practices of distributors, which accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, including increased use of alternative film delivery methods including premium video on demand, streaming platforms, shrinking exclusive theatrical release windows or release of movies to theatrical exhibition and streaming platforms on the same date, the theatrical release of fewer movies, or transitioning to other forms of entertainment;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe impact of changing movie-going behavior of consumers;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe risk that the North American and international box office in the near term will not recover sufficiently, resulting in higher cash burn and the need to seek additional financing;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nrisks and uncertainties relating to our significant indebtedness, including our borrowings and our ability to meet our financial maintenance and other covenants;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nrisks relating to motion picture production, promotion, marketing, and performance, including labor stoppages affecting the production, supply and release schedule of theatrical motion picture content, including but not limited to the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strikes during 2023;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nthe seasonality of our revenue and working capital, which are dependent upon the timing of motion picture releases by distributors, such releases being seasonal and resulting in higher attendance and revenues generally during the summer months and holiday seasons;\n\u200b\n2\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nintense competition in the geographic areas in which we operate among exhibitors, streaming platforms, or from other forms of entertainment;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ncertain covenants in the agreements that govern our indebtedness may limit our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities and limit or restrict our ability to pay dividends, pre-pay debt, and also to refinance debt and to do so at favorable terms;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nrisks relating to impairment losses, including with respect to goodwill and other intangibles, and theatre and other closure charges;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\ngeneral and international economic, political, regulatory, social and financial market conditions, including potential economic recession, inflation, rising interest rates, the financial stability of the banking industry, and other risks that may negatively impact discretionary income and our operating revenues and attendance levels;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nour lack of control over distributors of films;\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nlimitations on the availability of capital or poor financial results may prevent us from deploying strategic initiatives;

In addition, new risks and uncertainties may arise from time to time. Accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with an understanding of their inherent uncertainty and we caution accordingly against relying on forward-looking statements.\nExcept as required by law, we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements for any reason. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.\nReaders are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements. For further information about these and other risks and uncertainties as well as strategic initiatives, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d and Item\u00a01A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K.\n\u200b\n4\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPART\u00a0I\n\u200b\nItem\u00a0\n1.  Business\n.\n\u200b\nGeneral Development of Business\nAMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (\u201cHoldings\u201d), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cAMC\u201d), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres primarily located in the United States and Europe.\nOur business was founded in Kansas City, Missouri in 1920. Holdings was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on June\u00a06, 2007. We maintain our principal executive offices at One AMC Way, 11500 Ash Street, Leawood, Kansas 66211.\nLiquidity\nAt December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $884.3 million. \nAdditionally, we continued to lower our future interest expense through purchases of debt below par value and debt exchanges for equity and enhanced liquidity through equity issuances. See Note 8\n\u2014\nCorporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities, Note 9\n\u2014\nStockholders\u2019 Deficit, and Note 16\u2014Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for further information.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and satisfy our obligations currently and through the next twelve months. We are subject to a minimum liquidity requirement of $100.0 million as a condition to the financial covenant suspension period under the Credit Agreement \n(as defined in Note 8\n\u2014\nCorporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof). We believe we will comply with the minimum liquidity requirement through the current maturity date of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility on April 22, 2024. We currently do not expect to extend such maturity or replace the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility upon maturity, although we may seek to replace it in the future.\nOur cash burn rates are not sustainable long-term. In order to achieve sustainable net positive operating cash flows and long-term profitability, we believe that operating revenues will need to increase to levels in line with pre-COVID-19 operating revenues. North America box office grosses were down approximately 21% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Until such time as we are able to achieve positive operating cash flow, it is difficult to estimate our liquidity requirements, future cash burn rates, future operating revenues, and attendance levels. Depending on our assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve levels of operating revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly.\nThere can be no assurance that the operating revenues, attendance levels, and other assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements and future cash burn rates will be correct, and the ability to be predictive is uncertain due to limited ability to predict studio film release dates, the overall production and theatrical release levels, and success of individual titles. Additionally, the effects of labor stoppages, including but not limited to the Writers Guild of America strike and the Screen Actors Guild\u2013American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strike that occurred during 2023, cannot be reasonably estimated and are expected to have a negative impact in 2024 on the future film slate for exhibition, our future liquidity and cash burn rates. Further, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in generating the additional liquidity necessary to meet our obligations beyond twelve months from the issuance of this Annual Report on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe expect, at any time and from time to time, to continue to seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material and to the extent equity is used, dilutive. \nOn December 22, 2022, we entered into a forward purchase agreement (the \u201cForward Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Antara Capital LP (\u201cAntara\u201d) pursuant to which we agreed to (i) sell to Antara 10,659,511 AMC Preferred Equity \n5\n\n\nTable of Contents\nUnits for an aggregate purchase price of $75.1 million and (ii) simultaneously purchase from Antara $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 10%/12% Cash/PIK Toggle Second Lien Notes due 2026 in exchange for 9,102,619 AMC Preferred Equity Units. On February 7, 2023, we issued 19,762,130 AMC Preferred Equity Units to Antara in exchange for $75.1 million in cash and $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 10%/12% Cash/PIK Toggle Second Lien Notes due 2026. We recorded $193.7 million to stockholders\u2019 deficit as a result of the transaction. We paid $1.4 million of accrued interest in cash upon exchange of the notes. See Note 9\u2014Stockholders\u2019 Deficit for more information.\nThe below table summarizes the cash debt repurchase transactions during the year ended December 31, 2023, including related party transactions with Antara, which was a related party from February 7, 2023 to August 25, 2023. These transactions were executed at terms equivalent to an arms-length transaction.

Over the course of our 100+ year history, we have pioneered many of the theatrical exhibition industry\u2019s most important innovations. We introduced multiplex theatres in the 1960s and the North American stadium-seated Megaplex theatre format in the 1990s. Most recently, we continued to innovate and evolve the movie-going experience with the deployment of our theatre renovations featuring plush, powered recliner seating and the launch of our U.S. subscription loyalty tier, AMC Stubs\n\u00ae\n A-List. Our growth has been driven by a combination of organic growth through reinvestment in our existing assets and through the acquisition of some of the most significant companies in the theatrical exhibition industry.\nOur business is operated in two theatrical exhibition reportable segments, U.S. markets and International markets. Substantially all of our international operations are attributed to Odeon Cinemas Group Limited (\u201cOCGL\u201d) and its subsidiaries (collectively with OCGL, unless the context otherwise requires, \u201cOdeon Cinemas Group\u201d), Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (\u201cOdeon\u201d) and Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (\u201cNordic\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2023, we owned, leased or operated 898 theatres and 10,059 screens in 11 countries, including 562 theatres with a total of 7,369 screens in the United States and 336 theatres and 2,690 screens in European markets. On January 24, 2023, we sold our investment in 13 theatres and 85 screens in Saudi Arabia, see Note 6\u2014Investments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for further information. We have productive assets in each of the capital cities and most densely populated areas of the countries in which we operate.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were the market leader in the United States and Europe including in Italy, Sweden, Norway, and Finland, and a leading theatre operator in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Germany. We have operations in four of the world\u2019s 10 largest economies, including four of the six largest European economies (the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Germany) as of December 31, 2023.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, in the U.S. markets, we owned, leased or operated theatres in 43 states and the District of Columbia, with approximately 50% of the U.S. population living within 10 miles of one of our theatres. We have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles, which we believe gives our circuit a unique profile and offers us strategic and operational advantages while providing our studio partners with a large and diverse distribution channel. We operate some of the most productive theatres in the top markets in the United States and were the market leader in the top two markets for the year ended December 31, 2023: New York and Los Angeles. During 2023 our top five markets, in each of which we held the #1\u00a0share position, were New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, and Philadelphia, according to data provided by Comscore.\n7\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides detail with respect to the geographic location of our theatrical exhibition circuit as of December\u00a031, 2023:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nU.S. Markets\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTheatres(1)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nScreens(1)\n\u00a0\nAlabama\n\u00a0\n 18\n\u00a0\n 237\n\u200b\nArizona\n\u00a0\n 12\n\u00a0\n 187\n\u200b\nArkansas\n\u00a0\n 3\n\u00a0\n 35\n\u200b\nCalifornia\n\u00a0\n 58\n\u00a0\n 781\n\u200b\nColorado\n\u00a0\n 14\n\u00a0\n 193\n\u200b\nConnecticut\n\u00a0\n 9\n\u00a0\n 104\n\u200b\nDelaware\n\u00a0\n 1\n\u200b\n 14\n\u200b\nFlorida\n\u00a0\n 39\n\u00a0\n 600\n\u200b\nGeorgia\n\u00a0\n 27\n\u00a0\n 362\n\u200b\nIdaho\n\u200b\n 1\n\u200b\n 11\n\u200b\nIllinois\n\u00a0\n 47\n\u00a0\n 577\n\u200b\nIndiana\n\u00a0\n 21\n\u00a0\n 276\n\u200b\nIowa\n\u00a0\n 3\n\u00a0\n 43\n\u200b\nKansas\n\u00a0\n 9\n\u00a0\n 132\n\u200b\nKentucky\n\u00a0\n 2\n\u00a0\n 40\n\u200b\nLouisiana\n\u00a0\n 7\n\u00a0\n 99\n\u200b\nMaryland\n\u00a0\n 15\n\u00a0\n 171\n\u200b\nMassachusetts\n\u00a0\n 11\n\u00a0\n 155\n\u200b\nMichigan\n\u00a0\n 11\n\u00a0\n 162\n\u200b\nMinnesota\n\u00a0\n 7\n\u00a0\n 101\n\u200b\nMissouri\n\u00a0\n 10\n\u00a0\n 118\n\u200b\nMontana\n\u200b\n 5\n\u200b\n 55\n\u200b\nNebraska\n\u00a0\n 1\n\u00a0\n 14\n\u200b\nNevada\n\u00a0\n 2\n\u00a0\n 28\n\u200b\nNew Hampshire\n\u200b\n 1\n\u200b\n 10\n\u200b\nNew Jersey\n\u00a0\n 25\n\u00a0\n 319\n\u200b\nNew Mexico\n\u200b\n 1\n\u200b\n 12\n\u200b\nNew York\n\u00a0\n 30\n\u00a0\n 322\n\u200b\nNorth Carolina\n\u00a0\n 19\n\u00a0\n 244\n\u200b\nNorth Dakota\n\u200b\n 1\n\u200b\n 9\n\u200b\nOhio\n\u00a0\n 12\n\u00a0\n 151\n\u200b\nOklahoma\n\u00a0\n 12\n\u200b\n 147\n\u200b\nOregon\n\u200b\n 2\n\u200b\n 25\n\u200b\nPennsylvania\n\u00a0\n 27\n\u00a0\n 309\n\u200b\nSouth Carolina\n\u00a0\n 2\n\u00a0\n 26\n\u200b\nSouth Dakota\n\u200b\n 1\n\u200b\n 10\n\u200b\nTennessee\n\u200b\n 16\n\u200b\n 201\n\u200b\nTexas\n\u00a0\n 42\n\u00a0\n 608\n\u200b\nUtah\n\u00a0\n 3\n\u00a0\n 29\n\u200b\nVirginia\n\u00a0\n 13\n\u00a0\n 173\n\u200b\nWashington\n\u00a0\n 15\n\u00a0\n 181\n\u200b\nWest Virginia\n\u200b\n 1\n\u200b\n 12\n\u200b\nWisconsin\n\u00a0\n 5\n\u00a0\n 73\n\u200b\nDistrict of Columbia\n\u200b\n 1\n\u00a0\n 13\n\u200b\nTotal U.S. Markets\n\u200b\n 562\n\u200b\n 7,369\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nInternational Markets\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDenmark\n\u200b\n 2\n\u200b\n 12\n\u200b\nFinland\n\u200b\n 30\n\u200b\n 173\n\u200b\nGermany\n\u200b\n 22\n\u200b\n 197\n\u200b\nIreland\n\u200b\n 11\n\u200b\n 77\n\u200b\nItaly\n\u200b\n 41\n\u200b\n 416\n\u200b\nNorway\n\u200b\n 12\n\u200b\n 91\n\u200b\nPortugal\n\u200b\n 3\n\u200b\n 42\n\u200b\nSpain\n\u200b\n 35\n\u200b\n 414\n\u200b\nSweden\n\u200b\n 75\n\u200b\n 404\n\u200b\nUnited Kingdom\n\u200b\n 105\n\u200b\n 864\n\u200b\nTotal International Markets\n\u200b\n 336\n\u200b\n 2,690\n\u200b\nTotal \n\u00a0\n 898\n\u00a0\n 10,059\n\u200b\n(1)\nIncluded in the above table are 65 theatres and 320 screens that we manage or in which we have a partial ownership interest.

We offer consumers a broad range of entertainment alternatives including traditional film programming, private theatre rentals, independent and foreign films, performing arts, music and sports. We also offer food and beverage alternatives beyond traditional concession items, including collectible concession vessels, made-to-order meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, beer, wine, premium cocktails, and dine-in theatre options. The balance of our revenues is generated from ancillary sources, including on-screen advertising, fees earned from our customer loyalty programs, rental of theatre auditoriums, income from gift card and exchange ticket sales, theatrical distribution, retail popcorn sales, and online ticketing fees.\nOur Strategy\nWe are committed to maintaining a leadership position in the exhibition industry by focusing on forward-thinking initiatives for the benefit of our guests. We do this through a combination of unique marketing outreach, seamless digital technology and innovative theatre amenities designed to 1) transform AMC into a world-class leader in customer engagement, 2) deliver the best in-person experience while at AMC theatres, 3) selectively enhance our footprint through expansion in certain markets and strategic closure of underperforming theatres, 4) pursue adjacent opportunities that extend the AMC brand, and 5) explore attractive acquisitions leveraging our existing capabilities and core competencies. Consistent with our history and culture of innovation, we believe our vision and relentless focus on these key elements, which apply strategic and marketing components to traditional theatrical exhibition, will drive our future success. \n1)\nTransform AMC into a World-Class Leader in Customer Engagement\nWe engage movie-goers through advances in technology and marketing activities to strengthen the bonds with our current guests and create new connections with potential customers that drive both growth and loyalty. We serve our guests, end-to-end, from before they enter our theatres, through their enjoyment of a comprehensive spectrum of film content while at our theatres and then again after the movie when they\u2019ve left the theatre and are deciding what film to see the next time they visit.\nIn our U.S. markets, we begin the process of engagement with AMC Stubs\n\u00ae\n (\u201cStubs\u201d), our customer loyalty program, which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features a paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere\u2122 (\u201cPremiere\u201d) for a flat annual membership fee and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs Insider\u2122 (\u201cInsider\u201d). Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. \nAMC Stubs\n\u00ae\n \nA-List (\u201cA-List\u201d) is our monthly subscription-based tier of our Stubs loyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week, including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to movies from $19.95 to $24.95 per month depending upon the geographic market. A-List also includes premium offerings including IMAX\n\u00ae\n,\n Dolby Cinema\u2122 at AMC, RealD, Prime and other proprietary Premium Large Format (\u201cPLF\u201d) brands. A-List members can book tickets online in advance with reserved seating at AMC Theatres for no additional cost. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, we had a combined total of approximately 32 million member households enrolled in A-List, Premiere, and Insider programs. Our Stubs members represented approximately 46% of our U.S. market attendance during the year ended December\u00a0\n31, 2023. Our large database of identified movie-goers also provides us with additional insight into our customers\u2019 movie preferences. This enables us to have an increasingly comprehensive, more personalized and targeted marketing effort.  \nIn our International markets, we currently have loyalty programs in all territories in which we operate. Movie-goers can earn points for spending money at the theatre, and those points can be redeemed for tickets or food and beverage items, depending on the program, at a later date. We currently have approximately 16.6 million members in our various International loyalty programs. \nOur marketing efforts expand beyond our loyalty program. We continue to improve our customer connections through our website and mobile apps and expand our online and movie offerings. We upgraded our mobile applications across the U.S. circuit with the ability to order food and beverage offerings via our mobile applications while ordering tickets ahead of scheduled showtimes. \n9\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2021, the Company launched AMC Investor Connect (\u201cAIC\u201d), an innovative new communication initiative to engage directly with its sizable retail shareholder base and convert shareholders into AMC consumers. AIC allows our shareholders to self-identify through our website and receive special offers and important communications. As part of AIC, domestic members must sign up for a Stubs account, which includes providing additional personalized data that allows us to more precisely engage with our investor consumers. As of December 31, 2023, there were approximately 1.2 million global members of AIC, which is comprised of both registered and beneficial shareholders.\n2)\nDeliver the best in-person experience while at AMC theatres\nIn conjunction with our advances in technology and marketing initiatives, and consistent with our long-term growth strategy, we plan to continue investing in our theatres and enhancing the consumer experience to deliver the best in-person experience and take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through comfort and convenience innovations, imaginative food and beverage initiatives, and exciting PLF offerings. \nComfort and Convenience.\n  Recliner seating is a key feature of many of our locations. We believe that maximizing comfort and convenience for our customers will be increasingly necessary to maintain and improve our relevance. These locations include plush, electric recliners that allow customers to deploy a leg rest and fully recline at the push of a button. These locations typically warrant increased ticket prices to reflect the enhanced consumer experience. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, in our U.S. markets, we featured recliner seating in 362\u00a0U.S. theatres, including Dine-in-Theatres, totaling approximately 3,588\u00a0screens and representing 48.7% of total U.S. screens. In our International markets, as of December 31, 2023, we had recliner seating in 82 International theatres, totaling 554\u00a0screens and representing 20.6% of total International screens. \nOpen-source internet ticketing makes AMC\u2019s entire universe of seats in the U.S. (approximately 1\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2023), for all our show times, as available as possible, on as many websites and mobile applications as possible. Our tickets are currently sold either directly at the box office or through mobile apps, at our own website and mobile app and through other third-party ticketing vendors. For the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 69% of our tickets were purchased online in the U.S., with approximately 83% of total online tickets being purchased through our own website and mobile apps.\nImaginative Food and Beverage Initiatives.\n \nOur deployment initiatives also apply to food and beverage enhancements. We have expanded our menu of enhanced food and beverage products to include meals, healthy snacks, premium beers, wine and mixed drinks, and other gourmet products. Our long-term growth strategy calls for investment across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital-intensive food and beverage design improvements to the development of new dine-in theatre options. We have expanded the capabilities of our online and mobile apps to include the ability to pre-order food and beverages when advanced tickets are purchased. Guests then have the items ready upon arrival and available at dedicated pick-up areas or delivered to seat at select theatres.\nOur MacGuffins Bar and Lounges (\u201cMacGuffins\u201d) give us an opportunity to offer alcohol to our legal age customers in our U.S. markets. As of December\u00a031, 2023, we offered alcohol in 382 theatres in our U.S. markets and 231 theatres in our International markets.\nBelow is a summary of our recliner seating, Dine-In Theatres, and alcohol amenities by reportable segment as of December 31, 2023.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nU.S. Markets\n\u200b\nInternational Markets\n\u200b\nConsolidated\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031, \n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031, \n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031, \n\u200b\n\u200b\n2023\n\u200b\n2022\n\u200b\n2023\n\u200b\n2022\n\u200b\n2023\n\u200b\n2022\nRecliner screens operated\n\u00a0\n 3,588\n\u00a0\n 3,503\n\u200b\n 554\n\u00a0\n 621\n\u200b\n 4,142\n\u00a0\n 4,124\nRecliner theatres operated\n\u00a0\n 362\n\u00a0\n 361\n\u200b\n 82\n\u00a0\n 96\n\u200b\n 444\n\u00a0\n 457\nDine-In screens operated\n\u00a0\n 675\n\u00a0\n 684\n\u200b\n 13\n\u00a0\n 13\n\u200b\n 688\n\u00a0\n 697\nDine-In theatres operated\n\u00a0\n 49\n\u00a0\n 49\n\u200b\n 3\n\u00a0\n 3\n\u200b\n 52\n\u00a0\n 52\nNumber of theatres offering alcohol\n\u00a0\n 382\n\u00a0\n 357\n\u200b\n 231\n\u00a0\n 236\n\u200b\n 613\n\u00a0\n 593\n10\n\n\nTable of Contents\nExciting Premium Large Format Offerings\n.\n  PLF auditoriums generate our highest customer satisfaction scores, and we believe the investment in PLFs increases the value of the movie-going experience for our guests, ultimately leading to additional ticket revenue. To that end, we are committed to investing in and expanding our offerings of the best sight and sound experiences through a combination of our partnerships with IMAX\n\u00ae\n and Dolby Cinema\u2122 and the further development of our own proprietary PLF offerings.\n\u25cf\nIMAX\n\u00ae\n. \n IMAX\n\u00ae\n is one of the world\u2019s leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, AMC was the largest IMAX\n\u00ae\n exhibitor in the U.S., with 184 IMAX\n\u00ae\n screens and a 51% market share. Each one of our IMAX\n\u00ae\n local installations is protected by geographic exclusivity, and as of December\u00a031, 2023, our IMAX\n\u00ae\n screen count was 102% higher than our closest competitor. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, our per-screen grosses were 34% higher than our closest competition. We also operate 33 IMAX\u00ae screens in International markets. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we expect to continue to expand our IMAX\n\u00ae\n relationship across the U.S. and Europe, further strengthening our position as the largest IMAX\n\u00ae\n exhibitor in the U.S. and a significant IMAX\n\u00ae\n exhibitor in Europe. \n\u25cf\nDolby Cinema\u2122.\n  Dolby Cinema\u2122 offers a premium cinema offering for movie-goers that combines state-of-the-art image and sound technologies with inspired theatre design and comfort. Dolby Cinema\u2122 at AMC includes Dolby Vision\u2122 laser projection and object-oriented Dolby Atmos\n\u00ae\n audio technology, as well as AMC\u2019s plush power reclining seats with seat transducers that vibrate with the action on screen.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, we operated 162 Dolby Cinema\u2122 at AMC auditoriums in the U.S. and seven Dolby Cinema\u2122 auditoriums in the International markets. We expect to expand the deployment of our innovative Dolby Cinema\u2122 auditoriums in both our U.S. and International markets as part of our long-term growth strategy.\n\u25cf\nIn-house PLF Brands.  \nWe also offer our private label PLF experience at many of our locations, with superior sight and sound technology and enhanced seating as contrasted with our traditional auditoriums. These proprietary PLF auditoriums offer an enhanced theatrical experience for movie-goers beyond our current core theatres, at a lower price premium than IMAX\n\u00ae\n or Dolby Cinema\u2122. Therefore, it may be especially relevant in smaller or more price-sensitive markets. As of December\u00a031, 2023, we operated 57 screens under proprietary PLF brand names in the U.S. markets and 79 screens in the International markets.\nThe following table provides detail with respect to large screen formats, such as IMAX\n\u00ae\n and our proprietary Dolby Cinema\u2122, other PLF screens, enhanced food and beverage offerings and our premium seating as deployed throughout our circuit on December\u00a031, 2023 and December 31, 2022:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nU.S. Markets\n\u200b\nInternational Markets\n\u200b\nConsolidated\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDecember 31,\n\u200b\nDecember 31,\n\u200b\nDecember 31,\nFormat\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2022\nNumber of theatres:\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nIMAX\u00ae\n\u200b\n 183\n\u200b\n 185\n\u200b\n 33\n\u200b\n 35\n\u200b\n 216\n\u200b\n 220\nDolby Cinema\u2122 theatres\n\u00a0\n 162\n\u00a0\n 156\n\u200b\n 7\n\u00a0\n 9\n\u00a0\n 169\n\u00a0\n 165\nIn-house PLF\n\u200b\n 57\n\u200b\n 57\n\u200b\n 76\n\u200b\n 82\n\u200b\n 133\n\u200b\n 139\nDine-in\n\u00a0\n 49\n\u00a0\n 49\n\u200b\n 3\n\u00a0\n 3\n\u00a0\n 52\n\u00a0\n 52\nPremium seating\n\u200b\n 362\n\u200b\n 361\n\u200b\n 82\n\u200b\n 96\n\u200b\n 444\n\u200b\n 457\nNumber of screens:\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\nIMAX\u00ae\n\u200b\n 184\n\u200b\n 186\n\u200b\n 33\n\u200b\n 35\n\u200b\n 217\n\u200b\n 221\nDolby Cinema\u2122 theatres\n\u00a0\n 162\n\u00a0\n 156\n\u200b\n 7\n\u00a0\n 9\n\u00a0\n 169\n\u00a0\n 165\nIn-house PLF\n\u200b\n 57\n\u200b\n 57\n\u200b\n 79\n\u200b\n 83\n\u200b\n 136\n\u200b\n 140\nDine-in\n\u200b\n 675\n\u200b\n 684\n\u200b\n 13\n\u200b\n 13\n\u200b\n 688\n\u200b\n 697\nPremium seating\n\u200b\n 3,588\n\u200b\n 3,503\n\u200b\n 554\n\u200b\n 621\n\u200b\n 4,142\n\u200b\n 4,124\n\u200b\nLaser at AMC\n. \nWe launched Laser at AMC, a broadscale initiative to upgrade the projectors at 3,500 auditoriums throughout the U.S., with cutting-edge laser projectors.

The initial agreement to install 3,500 projectors is expected to be completed by 2026, with 1,325 installations completed as of December 31, 2023.  \n\u200b\n3)\nPerformance-Based Expansion and Strategic Closure of Theatres\nOur long-term growth strategy includes the deployment of our strategic growth initiatives, opening new-build theatres and continued exploration of small acquisitions. By expanding our platform through disciplined new-build theatres and acquisitions, we are able to further deploy our proven strategic initiatives while further diversifying our consumer base, leading to greater appeal for more films. The additional scale achieved through new-build theatres and acquisitions also serves to benefit our business through global procurement savings and increased overhead efficiencies. We believe that expansion offers us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest-focused strategies to movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, employees, studio partners and our shareholders. \nThe following table sets forth our historical information concerning new builds (including expansions), acquisitions and dispositions (including permanent closures of underperforming theatres and net construction closures) and end-of-period operated theatres and screens through December\u00a031, 2023:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nPermanent/Temporary\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNew\u00a0Builds\n\u200b\nAcquisitions\n\u200b\n(Closures), net\n\u200b\nTotal\u00a0Theatres\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNumber\u00a0of\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNumber\u00a0of\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNumber\u00a0of\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNumber\u00a0of\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNumber\u00a0of\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNumber\u00a0of\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNumber\u00a0of\n\u00a0\u00a0\nNumber\u00a0of\n\u00a0\nFiscal\u00a0Year\n\u200b\nTheatres\n\u200b\nScreens\n\u200b\nTheatres\n\u200b\nScreens\n\u200b\nTheatres\n\u200b\nScreens\n\u200b\nTheatres\n\u200b\nScreens\n\u00a0\nBeginning balance\n\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1,006\n\u00a0\n 11,091\n\u200b\n2019\n\u00a0\n 10\n\u200b\n 85\n\u200b\n 7\n\u200b\n 70\n\u200b\n (19)\n\u200b\n (205)\n\u00a0\n 1,004\n\u00a0\n 11,041\n\u200b\n2020\n\u00a0\n 8\n\u200b\n 63\n\u200b\n 1\n\u200b\n 14\n\u200b\n (63)\n\u200b\n (575)\n\u00a0\n 950\n\u00a0\n 10,543\n\u200b\n2021\n\u200b\n 10\n\u200b\n 82\n\u200b\n 11\n\u200b\n 140\n\u200b\n (25)\n\u200b\n (203)\n\u200b\n 946\n\u200b\n 10,562\n\u200b\n2022\n\u200b\n 7\n\u200b\n 51\n\u200b\n 15\n\u200b\n 157\n\u200b\n (28)\n\u200b\n (296)\n\u200b\n 940\n\u200b\n 10,474\n\u200b\n2023\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n 6\n\u200b\n 31\n\u200b\n (48)\n\u200b\n (446)\n\u200b\n 898\n\u200b\n 10,059\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 35\n\u00a0\n 281\n\u200b\n 40\n\u00a0\n 412\n\u00a0\n (183)\n\u00a0\n (1,725)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n4)\nPursue Adjacent Opportunities that Extend the AMC Brand\nWe believe there is considerable opportunity to extend and monetize the AMC brand outside of our movie theatre auditoriums. We plan to pursue opportunities that capitalize on our attractive customer base, our leading brand, our 100+ years of food and beverage expertise, and technology capabilities.\nAs part of that strategy, we have expanded our food and beverage business beyond theatrical exhibition and enter the multi-billion dollar popcorn industry with the launch of AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn in the U.S. markets.\n\u25cf\nDuring 2023, we began offering ready-to-eat and microwaveable AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn products that are available or will be available for purchase in well-known grocery stores around the country or on-line via Amazon.com.\n\u25cf\nFreshly popped AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn is available through food delivery-to-home services. \n\u25cf\n\u201cTo Go\u201d packages at our theatres of freshly popped popcorn are available for takeout and/or pickup.\nAMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn is an opportunity to diversify our business and to create a new food and beverage revenue stream.\nDuring 2023, we launched the AMC Entertainment Visa Card \u2013 the only co-branded movie theatre credit card in the United States. AMC Entertainment Visa Card cardholders earn Stubs rewards points with every purchase and extra points when making purchases at an AMC theatre.\nWe made our inaugural foray into theatrical distribution in 2023 when we, along with our sub-distribution partners, served as the theatrical distributor for two theatrical releases: \nTAYLOR SWIFT | THE ERAS TOUR\n and \nRENAISSANCE: A FILM BY BEYONC\u00c9\n. We have the potential to capitalize on new theatrical distribution opportunities \n12\n\n\nTable of Contents\nin the future which would lead to additional theatrical distribution revenue and increased admissions market share for the films we distribute.\n5)\nExplore Attractive Acquisitions Leveraging Our Existing Capabilities and Core Competencies\nAs part of our plans to pursue value-enhancing initiatives that lead to diversification of our business, we will consider attractive and opportunistic acquisitions inside and outside the theatrical exhibition industry that leverage our footprint and capabilities, as well as the core competencies and experiences of our management team.\n\u200b\nOur Competitive Strengths\n\u200b\nWe believe we have the following competitive strengths:\nLeading guest engagement through digital marketing and technology platforms.  \nThrough our Stubs loyalty programs, we have developed a consumer database of approximately 32 million households, representing approximately 64 million individuals. Our digital marketing and technology platforms allow us to engage with these customers frequently, efficiently and on a very personalized level. We believe personalized data drives increased engagement, resulting in higher attendance.\nLeading market share in important, affluent and diverse markets.  \nAs of December 31, 2023, across our three biggest metropolitan markets in the United States\u2014New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, representing 18% of the country\u2019s total box office\u2014we held a 44% combined market share. We operated theatres located in the top 25 U.S. markets, holding the #1 or #2 position in 18 of those 25\u00a0markets based on box office revenue. As of December 31, 2023 we are also the #1 theatre operator in Italy, Sweden, Norway, and Finland; the #2 operator in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain and Portugal, and the #4 operator in Germany. We believe our strong presence in these top markets makes our theatres highly visible and therefore strategically more important to content providers, who rely on the large audiences and marketing momentum provided by major markets to drive opinion-making and deliver a movie\u2019s overall box office results.\nWe also have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles. We have theatres in more densely populated major metropolitan markets, where there is also a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities, as well as complementary suburban and rural markets. Guests from different demographic and geographic profiles have different tastes in movies, and we believe by broadening our geographic base, we can help mitigate the impact of film genre volatility on our box office revenues.\nWell located and highly productive theatres.\n  Our theatres are generally located in the top retail centers across the U.S. We believe this provides for long-term visibility and higher productivity and is a key element in the success of our enhanced food and beverage and more comfort and convenience initiatives. Our location strategy, combined with our strong major market presence, enable us to deliver industry-leading theatre-level productivity. During the year ended December 31, 2023, 9 of the 10 highest grossing theatres in the U.S. were AMC theatres, according to data provided by Comscore. During the same period, AMC\u2019s U.S. markets average total revenues per theatre was approximately $6.6\u00a0million. This per unit productivity is important not only to content providers, but also to developers and landlords, for whom per location and per square foot sales numbers are critical measures.\nOur AMC Classic branded theatres are located primarily in smaller, suburban and rural markets, which affects total revenues per theatre. However, in general, theatres located in smaller suburban and rural markets tend to have less competition and a lower cost structure.\nIn our International markets, many theatres are located in top retail centers in major metropolitan markets with high visibility. We believe that deploying our proven strategic initiatives in these markets will help drive attendance and greatly improve productivity. Other theatres are in larger and mid-sized cities and towns in affluent regions.\nDeployment of unique pricing structures to enhance revenue.\n We have developed a dedicated pricing department and, as a result, we have deployed several different strategic pricing structures that have increased revenue and profitability.  \nA-List is our monthly subscription-based tier of our Stubs loyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week, including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to movies \n13\n\n\nTable of Contents\nfrom $19.95 to $24.95 depending on geographical market. We also offer Stubs members \u201cDiscount Tuesday\u201d, a reduced price for movie attendance on Tuesdays.  \nSources of Revenue\nBox Office Admissions and Film Content.\n Box office admissions are our largest source of revenue. We predominantly license theatrical films from distributors owned by major film production companies and from independent distributors on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Film exhibition costs are based on a share of admissions revenues and are accrued based on estimates of the final settlement pursuant to our film licenses. These licenses typically state that rental fees are based on the box office performance of each film, though in certain circumstances and less frequently, our rental fees are based on a mutually agreed settlement rate that is fixed. In some European territories, film rental fees are established on a weekly basis and some licenses use a per capita agreement instead of a revenue share, paying a flat amount per ticket.  \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, films licensed from our seven largest movie studio distributors based on revenues accounted for approximately 84% of our U.S. admissions revenues, which consisted of Universal, Disney, Warner Bros., Sony, Paramount, Lionsgate, and 20th Century Studios. In Europe, approximately 78% of our box office revenue came from films attributed to our five largest movie distributor groups, which consisted of Universal, Warner Bros., Disney, Sony, and Paramount. Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor\u2019s films in any given year.\nDuring 2023 we, along with our sub-distribution partners, served as the theatrical distributor for two theatrical releases: \nTAYLOR SWIFT | THE ERAS TOUR\n and \nRENAISSANCE: A FILM BY BEYONC\u00c9. \nThe distribution business is a new source of revenue that we have the potential to capitalize on in the future.\nFood and Beverage.\n Food and beverage\n \nsales are our second largest source of revenue after box office admissions. We offer enhanced food and beverage products that include meals, healthy snacks, premium liquor, beer and wine options, and other gourmet products. Our long-term growth strategy calls for investment across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital-intensive food and beverage menu improvements to the expansion of our Dine-In-Theatre brand. \nWe currently operate 49 Dine-In-Theatres in the U.S. and three Dine-In-Theatres in Europe that deliver chef-inspired menus with seat-side or delivery service to luxury recliners with tables. Our recent Dine-In-Theatre concepts are designed to capitalize on the latest food service trend, the fast and casual eating experience.\nMacGuffins give us an opportunity to offer alcohol to our legal age customers in our U.S. markets. As of December 31, 2023, we offered alcohol in approximately 382 theatres in our U.S. markets and 231 theatres in our International markets and continue to explore expansion globally.\nDuring 2023 we began offering ready-to-eat and microwaveable AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn products that are available or will be available for purchase in well-known grocery stores around the country or on-line via Amazon.com\nTheatrical Exhibition Industry and Competition\nU.S. markets.\n \nIn the U.S., the movie exhibition business is large and mature, however, the number of total screens in the U.S. has declined since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n We believe it is the quality of the movie-going experience that will define our future success. Whether through enhanced food and beverage options (Food and Beverage Kiosks, Marketplaces, Coca-Cola Freestyle, MacGuffins or Dine-in-Theatres), more comfort and convenience (recliner seating, open-source internet ticketing, reserved seating), engagement and loyalty (AMC Stubs\u00ae, mobile apps, social media, or AMC Investor Connect) or sight and sound (digital and laser projection, 3D, Dolby Cinema\u2122 at AMC, IMAX\u00ae  or other PLF screens), it is the ease of use and the amenities that these innovations bring to customers that we believe will help drive sustained profitability in the years ahead. \n\u200b\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents information about the U.S./Canada exhibition industry obtained from the National Association of Theatre Owners, with the exception of box office revenues for calendar years 2023, 2022, and 2021 obtained from Comscore.

Theatre appeal has proven resilient to competition for consumers\u2019 leisure spending and to recessionary periods. The European market lags the U.S. market across a number of factors, including annual spend per customer, number of IMAX\n\u00ae\n screens, and screens per capita, which causes us to believe that the deployment of our customer initiatives will be successful in these markets. Additionally, our European markets are more densely populated and operate with fewer screens per one\u00a0million of population, making the screens more valuable.\nU.S. films generate the majority of the box office in Europe, but movie-goers in specific geographies also welcome locally produced films with local actors and familiar story lines which can mitigate film genre attendance fluctuations. \nThe following table provides information about the exhibition industry attendance for the International markets where we operate obtained from territory industry trade sources; see Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 thereof for information regarding our operating data:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nCalendar Year\n(In millions)\n\u200b\n2023\n\u200b\n2022\n\u200b\n2021\n\u200b\n2020\n\u200b\n2019\nUnited Kingdom\n\u200b\n 124.4\n\u200b\n 117.5\n\u200b\n 74.6\n\u200b\n 44.0\n\u200b\n 176.0\nGermany\n\u200b\n 96.3\n\u200b\n 78.6\n\u200b\n 42.5\n\u200b\n 37.3\n\u200b\n 119.9\nItaly\n\u200b\n 75.9\n\u200b\n 47.9\n\u200b\n 26.6\n\u200b\n 30.2\n\u200b\n 104.7\nSpain\n\u200b\n 75.0\n\u200b\n 59.8\n\u200b\n 41.5\n\u200b\n 28.7\n\u200b\n 105.8\nPortugal\n\u200b\n 11.8\n\u200b\n 9.2\n\u200b\n 5.3\n\u200b\n 3.6\n\u200b\n 15.2\nIreland\n\u200b\n 11.6\n\u200b\n 10.7\n\u200b\n 6.1\n\u200b\n 3.9\n\u200b\n 15.1\nSweden\n\u200b\n 11.2\n\u200b\n 10.4\n\u200b\n 6.1\n\u200b\n 5.4\n\u200b\n 15.8\nNorway\n\u200b\n 9.3\n\u200b\n 8.8\n\u200b\n 5.6\n\u200b\n 4.8\n\u200b\n 11.3\nFinland\n\u200b\n 7.2\n\u200b\n 5.8\n\u200b\n 3.4\n\u200b\n 3.9\n\u200b\n 8.4\nTotal\n\u200b\n 422.7\n\u200b\n 348.7\n\u200b\n 211.7\n\u200b\n 161.8\n\u200b\n 572.2\n\u200b\nCompetition.\n Our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which they operate. Competition is often intense with respect to attracting patrons, licensing motion pictures and finding new theatre sites. Where real estate is readily available, it is easier to open a theatre near one of our theatres, which may adversely affect operations at our theatre. However, in certain of our densely populated major metropolitan markets, we believe a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities enhances the strategic value of our existing theatres. We also believe the complexity inherent in operating in these major metropolitan markets is a deterrent to other less sophisticated competitors, protecting our market share position.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe theatrical exhibition industry faces competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as concerts, amusement parks and sporting events, and from other distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such as video streaming services, premium video on demand (\u201cPVOD\u201d), cable television, pay-per-view, and home video systems, as well as from all other forms of entertainment.\nWe believe movie-going is a compelling consumer out-of-home entertainment experience. Movie theatres currently garner a relatively small share of overall consumer entertainment time and spend, and our industry benefits from available capacity to satisfy additional consumer demand.\nSeasonality\nOur revenues are dependent upon the timing of motion picture releases by distributors. The most marketable motion pictures are usually released during the summer and the year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is seasonal, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons.\nRegulatory Environment\nOur theatres in the U.S. must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d). Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations, including websites and mobile apps for such accommodations, be accessible to individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations are made to conform to accessibility guidelines. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and awards of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. As an employer covered by the ADA, we must make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of employees and qualified applicants with disabilities, provided that such reasonable accommodations do not pose an undue hardship on the operation of our business. In addition, many of our employees are covered by various government employment regulations, including minimum wage, overtime and working conditions regulations. In Europe, all territories have similar national regulations relating to disabilities.\nOur operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating such matters as construction, renovation and operation of theatres, as well as wages and working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements, consumer and employee privacy rights, and licensing, including alcoholic beverage sales. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.\nWe own and operate theatres and other properties in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark, which are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. Certain of these laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental protection, may impose joint and several liability on certain statutory classes of persons for the costs of investigation or remediation of contamination, regardless of fault or the legality of original disposal. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.\nHuman Capital Resources\n\u200b\nOur People.\n \nAMC promotes a healthy culture where people are encouraged to achieve their personal best and work together with integrity and openness to change. AMC associates are core to our commitment to deliver the best theatrical experience in the world. They uphold AMC\u2019s mission of focusing on the guest experience where excellent customer service is complemented with amazing food and beverage, comfort, and premium sight and sound.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we employed a total of 33,812 associates consisting of 2,881 full-time and 30,931 part-time associates, up from a total of 33,694 associates consisting of 2,787 full-time and 30,907 part-time associates as of December 31, 2022. Among our 33,812 associates, we employed 24,165 in the United States and 9,647 in our international markets. \nTalent Acquisition, Development and Retention.\n \nCritical to our operation is the hiring, development, and retention of qualified associates who support our guest-focused mission. Acquiring the right talent at speed and scale is a core capability that we regularly monitor and manage, given the need to rapidly staff our frontline operations at certain times of the year. Once hired, we train for success, creating experiences and programs that promote performance, growth, and long-term career opportunities. Programs like our Leadership Academy (AMC) and Incredible Leadership (Odeon) are designed to upskill and enhance managerial capability, facilitate quality execution of our business initiatives, drive guest satisfaction, and increase return on investment. Furthermore, our trainings include compulsory \n16\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmodules that meet regulatory requirements, policy enforcement and best practices to adhere to employment laws, practical tactics for safety and security, and compliance with anti-corruption regulations. Our measures to maintain a holistic view of the associate experience support the needs of our associates through engagement opportunities, including recognition programs and events.\nDiversity\n, Equity\n and Inclusion\n (\u201cDEI\u201d)\n.\n \nBelonging is fundamental to our culture and key to our success. AMC\u2019s efforts around DEI help us maintain a global workforce as diverse as the guests we serve and the movies we show on our screens. We provide a multi-channel approach to building awareness and training to reinforce an inclusive workplace through continuous learning opportunities. AMC has five DEI councils that are most representative of the largest diverse communities in our workforce: Women (42%), Latinx (27%), African American (19%), Asian American & Pacific Islander (4%), and LGBTQ+ (an emerging number). By appointing AMC officers to serve as Executive Sponsors, we ensure these efforts are championed at the highest levels of the Company, which has resulted in improved openness and reinforced the importance of all types of diversity in delivering our business outcomes. Our culture is strengthened as we embrace our diversity and lead with fairness and impartiality to create a more inclusive workplace. Additionally, our work has been recognized externally: AMC has received a perfect score for 15 consecutive years on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation\u2019s Corporate Equality Index as one of the \nBest Places to Work for LGBTQ\n \nEquality\n; 9 consecutive years as one of the \nBest Places to Work\n for people with disabilities through the Disability Equality Index; named one of Forbes \nBest Employers for Diversity\n from 2018-2022, and most recently recognized by Newsweek as one of \nAmerica\u2019s Greatest Workplaces for Diversity\n, \nAmerica\u2019s Greatest Workplaces for LGBTQ+\n, \nAmerica\u2019s Greatest Workplaces for Job Starters\n, and \nAmerica\u2019s Greatest Workplaces for Parents & Families\n.\nCompensation, Benefits, Safety and Wellness.\n \nWe offer market competitive salaries and wages, generally targeting market median, to attract and retain qualified talent. Our compensation programs are designed to drive engagement and support business objectives through pay-for-performance and incentive opportunities that reward the achievement of operational and financial goals. As part of our ongoing efforts to monitor and maintain pay equity, we partner with advisory companies to conduct statistical pay analysis using industry best practices to ensure pay programs are administered equitably. We also use the services of independent compensation consulting firms to advise on matters including market competitiveness and program design. \nIn addition, we prioritize and invest in our associate\u2019s health and welfare. Our \u201cLiveWell\u201d philosophy is based on a whole person approach to physical, fiscal, and emotional wellness tailored to the diverse needs of our global workforce in each country we operate. Examples, include global Employee Assistance Programs, Headspace Mindfulness application, Cuckoo application, and Mental Health First Aiders training. Comprehensive health and welfare benefits for eligible associates are supplemented with specific programs to manage or improve common health conditions, a variety of voluntary benefits to satisfy individual needs, and paid time off.\n Our commitment to the safety and health of our associates continues to be a top priority as demonstrated by our ongoing professional training and awareness campaigns.

Risk Factors\n. \nThe following is a summary list of risk factors:\nFinancial Risks\n\u25cf\nabsent more normalized levels of attendance and operating revenues, our ability to obtain additional liquidity, which if not realized or is insufficient, likely would result in us seeking an in-court or out-of-court restructuring of our liabilities, and in the event of such future liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, holders of our Common Stock and other securities would likely suffer a total loss of their investment;\n\u25cf\nour substantial level of indebtedness and our current liquidity constraints could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service our indebtedness, to pre-pay debt, and to refinance debt and to do so with comparable interest rates or other favorable terms, and our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities, which could negatively impact the ability of investors to recover their investment in our Common Stock\n;\n\u25cf\nrisks relating to impairment losses, including with respect to goodwill and other intangibles, and theatre and other closure charges;\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nlimitations on the availability of capital or poor financial results may prevent us from deploying strategic initiatives; and\n\u25cf\nwe are currently not paying dividends and in the future may not generate sufficient cash flows or have sufficient restricted payment capacity under our Credit Agreement or the indentures governing our debt securities to pay dividends on our Common Stock.\n\u200b\nOperational Risks\n\u25cf\nrisks relating to motion picture production and theatrical performance;\n\u25cf\nour lack of control over distributors of films;\n\u25cf\nincreased use of alternative film delivery methods, including premium video on demand or other forms of entertainment;\n\u25cf\nshrinking exclusive theatrical release windows or release of movies to theatrical exhibition and streaming platforms on the same date, and the production and theatrical release of fewer movies as a consequence of labor stoppages, increased cost of production, decreased consumer demand, or changes in strategic focus of studios;\n\u25cf\nintense competition in the geographic areas in which we operate among exhibitors or from other forms of entertainment;\n\u25cf\nfailures, unavailability or security breaches of our information systems;\n\u25cf\ndependence on key personnel for current and future performance and our ability to attract and retain senior executives and other key personnel, including in connection with any future acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nour ability to achieve expected synergies, benefits and performance from our strategic theatre acquisitions and strategic initiatives; \n\u25cf\nthe risk of severe weather events or other events caused by climate change disrupting or limiting operations;\n\u25cf\ngeneral and international economic, political, regulatory, social and financial market conditions, including potential economic recession, inflation, and other risks that may negatively impact discretionary income and our operating revenues and attendance levels;\n\u25cf\nthe availability and/or cost of energy in Europe may negatively impact our operating results;\n\u25cf\nsupply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and inflation may negatively impact our operating results; \n\u25cf\noptimizing our theatre circuit through new construction and the transformation of our existing theatres may be subject to delay and unanticipated costs; and\n\u25cf\nthe expiration of our current equity incentive plan could cause difficulties in retaining and hiring executives, which could cause an adverse impact on cash flow or adverse accounting consequences from alternative forms of compensation.\n\u200b\nRegulatory Risks\n\u25cf\ngeneral and international economic, political, regulatory, social and financial market conditions, including potential economic recession, inflation, and other risks that may negatively impact discretionary income and our operating revenues and attendance levels;\n\u25cf\nreview by antitrust authorities in connection with acquisition opportunities;\n\u25cf\nrisks relating to the incurrence of legal liability, including costs associated with ongoing securities class action lawsuits;\n\u25cf\nincreased costs in order to comply or resulting from a failure to comply with governmental regulation, including the GDPR and all other current and pending privacy and data regulations in the jurisdictions where we have operations; and\n\u25cf\nthe potential for political, social, or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities, cyber-attacks or war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and other international conflicts.\n\u200b\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Shares\n\u25cf\nthere has been significant recent dilution and there may continue to be additional future dilution of our Common Stock, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf\nthe market prices and trading volumes of our shares of Common Stock have experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our Common Stock to incur substantial losses; \n\u25cf\nthe risk of a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Common Stock that largely exceeds supply and/or focused investor trading in anticipation of a potential short squeeze has led to, may be currently leading to, and could again lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Common Stock; \n\u25cf\nthere is no guarantee that our retail stockholders will continue to support AMC in the future, and negative sentiment among AMC\u2019s retail stockholder base in the future could have a material adverse impact on the market price of the Common Stock and investor\u2019s investment therein;\n\u25cf\nfuture offerings of debt, which would be senior to our Common Stock upon liquidation, and/or other preferred equity securities, which may be senior to our Common Stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock; \n\u25cf\nanti-takeover protections in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may discourage or prevent a takeover of our Company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders; \n\u25cf\nan issuance of preferred stock, including the Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our Common Stock;\n\u25cf\ninformation available in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, online forums, message boards and social and other media may include statements not attributable to the Company and may not be reliable or accurate; and\n\u25cf\nincreases in market interest rates may cause potential investors to seek higher returns and therefore reduce demand for our Common Stock, which could result in a decline in the market price of our Common Stock.\n\u200b\nFinancial Risks\nIn the absence of significant increases in operating revenues and attendance from current levels, or obtaining significant additional sources of liquidity, an investment in our Common Stock is highly speculative; holders of our Common Stock could suffer a total loss of their investment.\n \nTo remain viable beyond the next twelve months, the Company is expected to require additional sources of liquidity, reductions or abatements of its rent obligations and/or significant increases in operating revenues and attendance levels\n, see Liquidity and Capital Resources\u2014For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022 included in Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a07 thereof for further information regarding operating revenue and attendance assumptions.\n The required amounts of additional liquidity may be material. Although the Company believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its material cash requirements over the next twelve months, it is actively continuing to explore additional sources of liquidity. The Company is unable to determine at this time whether any additional sources of liquidity will be available to it or if available, individually or taken together, will be sufficient to address its potential liquidity needs. There is significant uncertainty as to whether these potential sources of liquidity will be realized or that they will be sufficient to generate the material amounts of additional liquidity that may be required until the Company is able to achieve more normalized levels of attendance and operating revenues. Any individual source of liquidity that the Company is pursuing may not be sufficient to address all the Company\u2019s future liquidity requirements, and even if all of the potential sources of liquidity that the Company is pursuing are available, they may not be sufficient to address the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements. \nFurther, any relief provided by lenders, governmental agencies, and business partners may not be adequate and may include onerous terms, scheduled film releases may fail to drive increased operating revenues and attendance, scheduled releases may be postponed or moved to the home video market, or the attendance levels of, and revenues generated by, our theatres may normalize at a level that will not support our substantial amount of indebtedness, rent liabilities or other obligations. \nDue to these factors, if the Company is unable to obtain the necessary additional sources of liquidity, an investment in our Common Stock is highly speculative. \n21\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSignificant impacts on our business caused by changes in the film exhibition industry during the course of and after the COVID-19 pandemic include, and are likely to continue to include, among others: (1) decreased attendance at our theatres, including due to changes in consumer behavior in favor of viewing feature-length movies at home on directly to video streaming or PVOD platforms or spending on alternative forms of entertainment, (2) unavailability of employees due to general shortages in the labor market, (3) our inability to generate significant cash flow from operations if our theatres continue to operate at significantly lower than historical levels, which could lead to a need to increase our indebtedness, and negatively impact our ability to comply with the financial covenants, as applicable, in our debt agreements and (4) our inability to service our existing and future indebtedness or other liabilities.\nWith the changing operating landscape for the film exhibition industry following the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with decreases in revenue during that time frame, we may face difficulty in maintaining relationships with our creditors, landlords, vendors, motion picture distributors, customers, and employees. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, some movie studios have reduced the theatrical exclusive release window, have skipped a theatrical release and released their movies through streaming or other channels, or have announced that future theatrical releases will be released concurrently through streaming channels. Studios may continue to do so with additional releases.\nWork stoppages by the Writers Guild of America and Screen Actors Guild\n\u2013\nAmerican Federation of Television and Radio Artists during 2023 also had an impact upon the production pipeline for theatrical releases by most studios, which are expected to have the effect of decreasing the volume of theatrical releases in 2024, and therefore negatively affect our attendance levels and revenue. The new collective bargaining agreements with these labor unions may lead to increased costs to create content, which could cause studios to demand greater fees for the exhibition of their motion pictures, or further reduce the amount of future theatrical releases.\nIn the event the Company\u2019s operating revenues do not continue to increase to pre-COVID-19 levels, we would seek to negotiate with creditors changes to our balance sheet liabilities and continue to take steps to reach agreements with our landlords to reduce or abate our rent obligations. Ultimately, if operating revenues do not normalize and we are unsuccessful in restructuring our liabilities, we would face the risk of a future liquidation or bankruptcy proceeding, in which case holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock would likely suffer a total loss of their investment. \nOur substantial level of indebtedness and liquidity constraints could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to service our indebtedness, which could negatively impact an investor\u2019s ability to recover their investments in the Common Stock.\n \nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. \nAs of December\u00a031, 2023, the carrying value of our corporate borrowings and finance lease obligations were $4,577.4\u00a0million ($4,504.3\u00a0million aggregate principal amount) and $55.4 million, respectively. As of December\u00a031, 2023, we also had approximately $4.5\u00a0billion of discounted rental payments under operating leases (with a weighted average remaining lease term of 8.7 years).\n \nIncluding repayments of deferred lease amounts, the Company\u2019s cash expenditures for rent increased substantially in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2021 and throughout 2022 and 2023 as previously deferred rent payments and landlord concessions started to become current obligations. The Company received rent concessions provided by the lessors that aided in mitigating the economic effects of COVID-19 during the pandemic. These concessions primarily consisted of rent abatements and the deferral of rent payments. As a result, deferred lease amounts were approximately $56.3 million as of December 31, 2023. See Note 3\n\u2014\nLeases in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for a summary of the estimated future repayment terms for the deferred lease amounts due to COVID-19.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness and the current constraints on our liquidity could have important consequences, including the following: \n\u25cf\nwe entered into the Ninth Amendment (as defined in Note 8\n\u2014\nCorporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof)\n, pursuant to which the requisite revolving lenders party thereto agreed to extend the fixed date for the termination of the suspension period for the financial covenant applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022, which was further extended by the Eleventh \n22\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAmendment (as defined in Note 8\n\u2014\nCorporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof)\n and Twelfth Amendment (as defined in Note 8\n\u2014\nCorporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof) \nfrom March 31, 2022 to March 31, 2023 and then from March 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024, respectively, in each case, as described, and on the terms and conditions specified, therein, including a minimum liquidity requirement of $100 million during the covenant suspension period. A breach of any condition to the financial covenant suspension set forth in the Credit Agreement may result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement or resume testing of the financial covenant. The current maturity date of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is April 22, 2024 and we currently do not expect to extend such maturity or replace the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility upon such maturity; \n\u25cf\nwe must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, which reduces or will reduce funds available to us for other purposes such as working capital, capital expenditures, other general corporate purposes and potential acquisitions; \n\u25cf\nour ability to refinance such indebtedness or to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired; \n\u25cf\nwe are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates because our senior credit facilities have variable rates of interest; \n\u25cf\nour leverage may be greater than that of some of our competitors, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in responding to current and changing industry and financial market conditions; \n\u25cf\nthere are significant constraints on our ability to incur additional debt; and \n\u25cf\nwe may be more vulnerable to economic downturn and adverse developments in our business. \n\u200b\n\u200b \nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions and compliance obligations contained in the agreements governing our indebtedness. To the extent new indebtedness is added to our debt levels, including as a result of satisfying interest payment obligations on certain of our indebtedness with payments-in-kind, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nOur ability to meet our expenses, to remain in compliance with our covenants under our debt instruments and to make future principal and interest payments in respect of our debt depends on, among other factors, our operating performance, competitive developments and financial market conditions, all of which are significantly affected by financial, business, economic and other factors outside of our control. Given current industry and economic conditions, our cash flow may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. \nTo the extent our relationship with lenders is negatively affected by disputes that may arise from time to time, it may be more difficult to seek covenant relief, if needed, or to raise additional funds in the future. \nWe may incur future impairment charges to goodwill, other intangibles, or long-lived assets and future theatre and other closure charges.\n \nWe have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet as a result of acquisitions. As of December\u00a031, 2023, goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet totaled $2,358.7\u00a0million. If the market price of our Common Stock declines, if the fair value of our debt declines, or if other events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their respective carrying value, all or a portion of our goodwill may be impaired in future periods. \nWe review long-lived assets, goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other intangible assets and theatre assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. The review for goodwill compares the fair value for each of our reporting units to their associated carrying value. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, and declines in the market price of our Common Stock or declines in the fair value of our debt. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments \n23\n\n\nTable of Contents\nand assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance, including estimating the fair value of our corporate borrowings and finance lease liabilities. We may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist. During the years ended December\u00a031, 2023, December\u00a031, 2022, and December\u00a031, 2021, we recorded impairment of long-lived asset charges of $106.9 million, $133.1 million, $77.2\u00a0million, respectively. The assets impaired during year 2023 included 68\u00a0theatres in the U.S. markets with 738\u00a0screens and 57 theatres in the International markets with 488\u00a0screens. We did not record any goodwill non-cash impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021 as we determined it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units was below their respective carrying values.\nLimitations on the availability of capital and reductions to capital expenditures may delay or prevent deployment of strategic initiatives.\nImplementation of our key strategic initiatives, including premium sight and sound, other upgrades to auditoriums, and food and beverage enhancements require significant capital expenditures. Our gross capital expenditures were approximately $225.6\u00a0million, $202.0\u00a0million, and $92.4\u00a0million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2023, December\u00a031, 2022 and December\u00a031, 2021, respectively. We estimate that our cash outflows for capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions, will be approximately $175\u00a0million to $225 million for the year ending December\u00a031, 2024 to maintain and enhance operations. A lack of available capital resources due to business performance or other financial commitments could prevent or delay the deployment of innovations in our theatres. We may reduce capital expenditures significantly or seek additional financing or issue additional securities, which may affect the timing and scope of growth strategy. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain new financing on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, covenants under our existing indebtedness limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, and the performance of any additional or improved theatres may not be sufficient to service the related indebtedness that we are permitted to incur.\nWe are currently not paying dividends and in the future may not generate sufficient cash flows or have sufficient restricted payment capacity under our Credit Agreement or the indentures governing our debt securities to pay dividends on our Common Stock.  \nWe are currently not paying a cash dividend. We are only able to pay dividends from our available cash on hand and funds received from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries' ability to make distributions to us will depend on their ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders in the future is subject to the terms of our Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Our operating cash flow and ability to comply with restricted payment covenants in our debt instruments will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed, and our board of directors may determine not to resume the payment of dividends. We may not pay dividends as a result of the following additional factors, among others:\n\u25cf\nwe are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends;\n\u25cf\neven if we determine to resume paying cash dividends, the actual amount of dividends distributed and the decision to make any distribution is entirely at the discretion of our board of directors and future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, business opportunities, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to deduct all or significant portions of our interest expense for tax purposes, will ultimately increase the need to generate revenues to support our capital structure;\n\u25cf\nthe amount of dividends distributed is and will be subject to contractual restrictions under the restrictive payment covenants contained in the indentures governing our debt securities, the terms of our Credit Agreement, and the terms of any other outstanding or future indebtedness incurred by us or any of our subsidiaries; and\n\u25cf\nthe amount of dividends distributed is subject to state law restrictions. \n\u200b\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOperational Risks\nOur business depends on motion picture production and performance and is subject to intense competition, including increases in alternative film delivery methods or other forms of entertainment.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets. The most attended films are usually released during the summer and the calendar year-end holidays, making our business seasonal. We primarily license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios and the duration of the exclusive theatrical release windows. Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), a reduction in, or suspension of, the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, the choice by distributors to release fewer feature-length movies theatrically, or the choice to release feature-length movies directly to video streaming or PVOD platforms, either in lieu of or on the same date as a theatrical release, could hurt our business and results of operations. Conversely, the successful performance of these motion pictures, particularly the sustained success of any one motion picture, or an increase in effective marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios and extension of the exclusive theatrical release windows, may generate positive results for our business and operations in a specific fiscal quarter or year that may not necessarily be indicative of, or comparable to, future results of operations. As movie studios rely on a smaller number of higher grossing \u201ctent pole\u201d films there may be increased pressure for higher film licensing fees. Our loyalty program and certain promotional pricing also may affect performance and increase the cost to license motion pictures relative to revenue for admission. In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios and the theatrical exclusive release window may adversely affect the demographic base of movie-goers.\nMotion picture production is highly dependent on labor that is subject to various collective bargaining agreements. Stikes by the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild\u2013American Federation of Television and Radio Artists during 2023 halted production of motion pictures for several months, and are expected to delay or otherwise affect the supply, of certain motion pictures. The disruption in film production may also cause delays for currently scheduled film release dates. It is difficult to anticipate the scope and timing of such delays. It is difficult to predict the full extent of the adverse impact of the strikes on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations in future reporting periods. Studios are party to collective bargaining agreements with a number of other labor unions, and failure to reach timely agreements or renewals of existing agreements, including pending renewals with the American Federation of Musicians and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, may further affect the production and supply of theatrical motion picture content.\nOur theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which we operate. Competitors may be multi-national circuits, national circuits, regional circuits or smaller independent exhibitors. Competition among theatre exhibition companies is often intense with respect to attracting patrons, terms for licensing of motion pictures and availability and securing and maintaining desirable locations.\nWe also compete with other film and content delivery methods, including video streaming, network, syndicated cable and satellite television, as well as video-on-demand, pay-per-view services, subscription streaming services, and social media platforms. We also compete for the public\u2019s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, video gaming, social media, amusement parks, live music concerts, live theatre, and restaurants. An increase in the popularity of these alternative film delivery methods and other forms of entertainment could reduce attendance at our theatres, limit the prices we can charge for admission and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on distributors of motion pictures, over whom we have no control, for the films that we exhibit, and our business may be adversely affected if our access to motion pictures is limited or delayed.\n \nOur business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors, as this affects our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films or to obtain licenses at all. With only seven movie studio distributors representing approximately 84% of our U.S. markets\u2019 box office revenues in 2023 and five movie studio distributors representing approximately 78% of our International markets\u2019 box office revenues in 2023, there is a high level of concentration and continued consolidation in the industry. Our business may be adversely affected if our access to motion pictures is limited or delayed because of deterioration in our relationships with one or more distributors \n25\n\n\nTable of Contents\nor for some other reason. To the extent that we are unable to license a popular film for exhibition in our theatres, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations will be impacted by shrinking theatrical exclusive release windows and other practices adopted by movie studies.\n \nOver the last decade, the average theatrical exclusive release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film\u2019s theatrical release to the date a film is available to consumers in-home, has decreased from approximately four\u00a0months to approximately one-and-one half\u00a0months. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, certain movie studios adopted strategies that have eliminated the theatrical exclusive release window. While this trend has diminished in 2023 as the COVID-19 pandemic has diminished, studios may adopt similar strategies in the future that shorten or eliminate the theatrical release window. These practices have significantly impacted our revenues and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations going forward. \nWe rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and any failure to protect these systems against security breaches or failure of these systems themselves could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity and could result in litigation and penalties. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nPotential cybersecurity incidents could interfere with our business and operations. Computer hacking, installation of malware, installation of ransomware, phishing, and spamming attacks against online networking platforms have become more prevalent and more sophisticated. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific attack or interruption, such events could also be expensive to remedy, harm our reputation or brands, lead users to lose trust and confidence in our business, and/or result in costly fines, penalties, and costly remediation requirements. We, and others on our behalf, also store \u201cpersonally identifiable information\u201d (\u201cPII\u201d) with respect to employees, vendors, customers, and others. We and our third-party vendors have been subject to, and will likely continue to be subject to, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our and their information systems. None of these attempts has individually or in the aggregate resulted in a cybersecurity incident with a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. While we have implemented safeguards to protect the privacy of PII, there is still a risk of a material cybersecurity incident where hackers or others might obtain information, which could result in potentially costly remedial action, as well as potential fines, penalties, lawsuits, and reputational damage.\nFurthermore, we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for storing proprietary company information about our products and intellectual property, as well as for processing patron purchases, loyalty program activity, supporting accounting functions and financial statement preparation, paying our employees, and otherwise running our business. In addition, we may need to enhance our information systems to provide additional capabilities and functionality. The implementation of new information systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise. Any disruptions affecting our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis could adversely affect our business in a number of respects. If we are unable to successfully implement potential future system enhancements, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nWe depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.\nOur current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the retention of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot give assurance that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.\nSupply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and inflation may negatively impact our operations and operating results.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain products, supplies and services, including a single U.S. vendor for the warehousing and distribution of most of the products and supplies for our U.S. food and beverage operations. Items such as consumable oils used in food preparation and containers/packaging for food and beverage service have been impacted by price and availability in both the U.S. markets and International markets. Shortages, delays, or interruptions in the availability of food and beverage items and other supplies to our theatres may be caused by commodity availability; public health crises or pandemics, including resulting lockdowns in areas where goods are \n26\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmanufactured; social or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities, cyber-attacks or war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the potential impact of financial and economic sanctions on the regional and global economy; labor issues or other operational disruptions; the inability of our suppliers to manage adverse business conditions, obtain credit or remain solvent; adverse weather conditions; natural disasters; governmental regulation; recalls; or other conditions beyond our control. Such shortages, delays or interruptions could adversely affect the availability, quality, and cost of the items we buy and the operations of our business. Supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products that are critical to our operations. If we raise prices in response to increased costs or shortages, it may negatively impact our sales. If we temporarily remove popular food and beverage options without comparable alternatives, we may experience a reduction in sales during the time affected by the shortage or thereafter if our guests change their purchasing habits. \nDuring the recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have, with regard to certain items, experienced difficulties in maintaining a consistent supply, seen delays in production and deliveries, been required to identify alternative suppliers, and suspended sales regionally or entirely. We expect these issues to continue for the foreseeable future and plan to minimize the impact by focusing on the supply of those items with the greatest impact on our sales and operations.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to recruit and retain staff members for our theatres. Labor shortages and demand for staff are becoming more prominent after the COVID-19 pandemic. Without proper staffing, wait times to buy tickets and concessions are extended, operating hours may be reduced, and, in some cases, theatres cannot open at all. As patrons return to our theatres in greater numbers, these conditions may result in a poor guest experience, perhaps causing them to not return in the future. These labor shortages have also required us to raise wages to be competitive in the small available workforce. Increased labor costs cut into profits already impacted by COVID-19 and the recovery from the pandemic.\nIn addition, we are dependent upon natural gas and electricity to operate our theatres. The cost of natural gas and electricity may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulations, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices, including the availability and/or cost of energy in Europe, for, or shortages of, natural gas and electricity could have a negative effect on our profitability. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions.\nIn an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the market conditions in each region or country, we may be unable to raise the prices of our movie tickets or food and beverage products enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profitability, and continued inflationary pressures could impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOptimizing our theatre circuit through new construction and the transformation of our existing theatres may be subject to delay and unanticipated costs. \nThe availability of attractive site locations for new construction is subject to various factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf\nlocal conditions, such as scarcity of space or increase in demand for real estate, demographic changes and changes in zoning and tax laws; and\n\u25cf\ncompetition for site locations from both theatre companies and other businesses.\nWe typically require 18 to 24\u00a0months in the United States from the time we reach an agreement with a landlord to when a theatre opens. This timeframe may vary in International markets. \nIn addition, the improvement of our existing theatres through our enhanced food and beverage offerings, recliner seating, and premium sight and sound initiatives is subject to substantial risks, such as difficulty in obtaining permits, landlord approvals and operating licenses (e.g.,\u00a0liquor licenses). We may also experience cost overruns from delays or other unanticipated costs in both new construction and facility improvements. Furthermore, our new sites and transformed locations may not perform to our expectations.\n27\n\n\nTable of Contents\nClimate change, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could adversely affect our theatre operations, sales or financial results.\nClimate change and natural disasters may adversely affect our ability to keep movie theatres open and operational in affected regions and consumer ability to travel to our theatres if they are open. Relative to normal weather conditions, extended severe weather as a result of climate change can close theatres for days due to pervasive power outages, flooding, or wildfires. These severe weather events can also result in delays in the construction of new theatres, interruptions to the availability or increases in the cost of utilities, and shortages in the supply, or increases in the costs of concessions and other supplies required for operations. Additionally, the seasonal timing of severe weather patterns tends to mimic the fluctuation of our sales. With our busy season being around the winter holidays and in the summer, the risk is even greater for extended severe winter storms and increased hurricanes and tornadoes in the summer months.\nThe Company's current equity incentive plan expired in December 2023 and a new equity incentive plan has not been put into place. Without a new equity incentive plan, the Company could experience difficulties retaining and hiring executives due to its inability to issue compensatory equity awards and could experience an adverse impact on its cash flow or adverse accounting consequences from alternative forms of compensation.\nThe current equity incentive plan of the Company expired at the end of its 10-year term in December 2023. As required by New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) rules, the Company intends to ask its stockholders for approval of a new equity incentive plan at its 2024 annual meeting. There can be no guarantee that the stockholders will approve a new plan. The absence of an equity incentive plan may create challenges for executive recruitment and retention. Absent a new plan, the Company could issue equity-related awards to be settled in cash. The issuance of such awards may mitigate short-term risks related to executive recruitment and retention, but cash settlements of these awards would negatively impact cash flow and would require the Company to account for these awards based on the fair value of the related equity at the end of each reporting period, giving effect to the portion of services rendered during the requisite service periods. Until such time as the stockholders approve a new equity incentive plan, equity-related awards made to executives would need to be settled in cash. Continued issuance of cash-settled awards may not be sustainable given the Company\u2019s cash flow challenges. The operating cash flow of the Company is still negative. \nRegulatory Risks\nGeneral political, social and economic conditions can reduce our operating revenues and attendance.\nOur success depends on general political, social, and economic conditions and the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres. If going to motion pictures becomes less popular or consumers spend less on food and beverage, our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our operations could be adversely affected if consumers\u2019 discretionary income falls as a result of an economic downturn. Geopolitical events, including the threat of regional war, terrorism or cyber-attacks, or widespread health emergencies, such as pandemics or epidemics, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.\nWe are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices both domestically and internationally affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating antitrust, customary health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, licensing for the sale of food and, in some theatres, alcoholic beverages, and data protection and privacy laws, including GDPR, and all other current and pending privacy and data regulations in the jurisdictions where we have operations. Our new theatre openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing theatres could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business. A significant portion of our theatre level employees are part-time workers who are paid at or near the applicable minimum wage in the theatre\u2019s jurisdiction. Increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.\nWe own and operate facilities throughout the United States and various international markets throughout Europe and are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of those jurisdictions, particularly laws governing the cleanup of hazardous materials and the management of properties. We might in the future be required to participate in the cleanup of a property that we own or lease, or at which we have been alleged to have disposed of hazardous materials \n28\n\n\nTable of Contents\nfrom one of our facilities. In certain circumstances, we might be solely responsible for any such liability under environmental laws, and such claims could be material. \nIn the United States, our theatres must comply with Title III of the ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations, including websites and mobile apps for such public accommodations, \u201creasonably accommodate\u201d individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to \u201ccommercial facilities\u201d conform to accessibility guidelines unless \u201cstructurally impracticable\u201d for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and an award of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. In Europe, all territories have similar national regulations relating to disabilities that our theatres operate in accordance with. Noncompliance with these regulations could carry financial, operational and reputation risks.\nWe are subject to complex taxation, changes in tax rates, adoption of new United States, European Union or international tax legislation and disagreements with tax authorities that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to many different forms of taxation in both the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Current economic and political conditions make compliance with domestic and international tax and transfer pricing laws and regulations, including in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union subject to ongoing change. The cost of compliance is high and likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and could subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nNumerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d) model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15% and European Union member states have agreed to implement the global minimum tax. Certain countries, including European Union member states, have enacted or are expected to enact legislation to be effective as early as 2024, with widespread implementation of a global minimum tax expected by 2025. We will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by individual countries and evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods. \nThe legal regimes governing our international business operations could require our international subsidiaries or their directors to pursue insolvency proceedings.\n \nThe legal regimes governing certain of our international subsidiaries (including Germany, Spain, Portugal, Norway and Sweden) impose on directors an obligation to pursue insolvency proceedings in certain circumstances. There are various potential triggers including illiquidity, over-indebtedness and inadequate capitalization. If our international subsidiaries were required to (and did) pursue insolvency proceedings, that could in turn trigger events of default under our international senior secured notes and/or have other material adverse effects on our business and financial position, including additional insolvency proceedings. \nWe may be reviewed by antitrust authorities.\nGiven our size and market share, pursuit of acquisition opportunities that would increase the number of our theatres in markets where we have a leading market share would likely result in significant review by antitrust regulators in the applicable jurisdictions, and we may be required to dispose of theatres in order to complete such acquisition opportunities. As a result, we may not be able to succeed in acquiring other exhibition companies or we may have to dispose of a significant number of theatres in key markets in order to complete such acquisitions.\nWe operate in a consolidating industry that is scrutinized from time to time for compliance with antitrust and competition laws, including currently dormant investigations into film clearances and joint ventures among competing exhibitors. If we were found to have violated antitrust laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\n29\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of our international operations, 23.4% of our revenues were derived from countries outside the United States for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023. The success of our international operations is subject to risks that are beyond our control. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations among diverse geographies, languages and cultures;\n\u25cf\nthe impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;\n\u25cf\nthe potential for political, social, or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities, cyber-attacks or war, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and other international conflicts, and adverse changes in political or economic relations with the United States; \n\u25cf\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could lead to fluctuations in our reported results of operations or result in significant decreases in the value of our international investments as denominated in U.S. Dollars;\n\u25cf\nincreased foreign interest rates, foreign exchange fees and other bank charges as a result of financing our foreign operations;\n\u25cf\nexposure to anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Bribery Act (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d), and export-control regulations and economic sanctions regulations, including those promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, United States Department of Treasury (\u201cOFAC\u201d);\n\u25cf\nexposure to local economic conditions, labor and employment conditions, and local laws and regulations, including data privacy laws, tariffs, or other trade barriers;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty in protecting our brand, reputation and intellectual property; and\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the ability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation.\nIf we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Related to our Share Issuances\nThere has been significant recent dilution and there may continue to be additional future dilution of our Common Stock, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our Common Stock. \nFrom January 1, 2020 through February 21, 2024, the outstanding shares of our Common Stock have increased by 258,070,230 shares (on a Reverse Stock Split adjusted basis) in a combination of at-the-market sales, conversion of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, shareholder litigation settlement, conversion of Class B common stock, conversion of notes, exchanges of notes, transaction fee payments, and equity grant vesting. On March 14, 2023, the Company held the Special Meeting and obtained the requisite stockholder approval for the Charter Amendments and on August 14, 2023, we filed the amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation implementing the Charter Amendments effective as of August 24, 2023. Accordingly, in accordance with the Charter Amendments, we increased the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 524,173,073 to 550,000,000 shares of Common Stock and effectuated a reverse stock split at a ratio of one share of Common Stock for every ten shares of Common Stock outstanding. In accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Designations governing the Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, following the effectiveness of the Charter Amendments all outstanding shares of our Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock converted into 99,540,642 shares of Common Stock. As of February 21, 2024, there were 263,278,238 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. We expect to issue additional shares of Common Stock to raise cash to bolster our liquidity, to repay, refinance, redeem or exchange indebtedness (including expenses, accrued interest and premium, if any), for working capital, to finance strategic initiatives and future acquisitions or for other purposes. We may also issue preferred equity securities or securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of Common Stock or acquire interests in other companies, or other assets by using a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, or just shares of Common Stock. \n30\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, vesting under our equity compensation programs results in the issuance of new shares of Common Stock and shares withheld to cover tax withholding obligations upon vesting remain available for future grants. Any of these events would likely dilute the ownership interests of current stockholders and reduce our earnings per share, and could have an adverse effect on the price of our shares of Common Stock. For capitalized terms used herein but not defined see Note 9\u2014Stockholders\u2019 Deficit in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof.\nThe market price and trading volume of our shares of Common Stock have experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our Common Stock to incur substantial losses.\nThe market prices and trading volume of our shares of Common Stock have experienced, and may continue to experience, extreme volatility, which could cause purchasers of our Common Stock to incur substantial losses. For example, during 2023 through February 21, 2024, as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split, the market price of our Common Stock has fluctuated from an intra-day low of $3.59 per share on February 6, 2024 to an intra-day high on the NYSE of $85.30 on February 28, 2023. The last reported sale price of our Common Stock on the NYSE on February 21, 2024 was $4.57 per share. During 2023 through February 21, 2024, daily trading volume ranged from approximately 771,720 to 84,989,600 shares.\nWe believe that the volatility and our market prices have reflected and may continue to reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business, or macro or industry fundamentals, and we do not know how long these dynamics will last. \nExtreme fluctuations in the market price of our Common Stock have been accompanied by reports of strong and atypical retail investor interest, including on social media and online forums. The market volatility and trading patterns we have experienced create several risks for investors, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe market price of our Common Stock has experienced and may continue to experience rapid and substantial increases or decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, or macro or industry fundamentals, and substantial increases may be significantly inconsistent with the risks and uncertainties that we continue to face;\n\u25cf\nfactors in the public trading market for our Common Stock may include the sentiment of retail investors (including as may be expressed on financial trading and other social media sites and online forums), the direct access by retail investors to broadly available trading platforms, the amount and status of short interest in our securities, access to margin debt, trading in options and other derivatives on our Common Stock and any related hedging and other trading factors;\n\u25cf\nour market capitalization, as implied by various trading prices, currently reflects valuations that diverge significantly from those seen prior to recent volatility, and to the extent these valuations reflect trading dynamics unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, purchasers of our Common Stock could incur substantial losses if there are declines in market prices;\n\u25cf\nto the extent volatility in our Common Stock is caused, or may from time to time be caused, as has widely been reported, by a \u201cshort squeeze\u201d in which coordinated trading activity causes a spike in the market price of our Common Stock as traders with a short position make market purchases to avoid or to mitigate potential losses, investors purchase at inflated prices unrelated to our financial performance or prospects, and may thereafter suffer substantial losses as prices decline once the level of short-covering purchases has abated; and\n\u25cf\nif the market price of our Common Stock declines, you may be unable to resell your shares of Common Stock at or above the price at which you acquired them. We cannot assure you that the equity issuance of our Common Stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future, in which case you could incur substantial losses. \n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWe may continue to incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in the market price of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future that may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by or affecting us. Accordingly, the market price of our shares of Common Stock may fluctuate dramatically and may decline rapidly, regardless of any developments in our business. Overall, there are various factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could negatively affect the market price of our Common Stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our Common Stock, including:\n\u25cf\nthe impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in our annual or quarterly results of operations, including our earnings estimates and whether we meet market expectations with regard to our earnings; \n\u25cf\nour current inability to pay dividends or other distributions; \n\u25cf\npublication of research reports by analysts or others about us or the motion picture exhibition industry, which may be unfavorable, inaccurate, inconsistent or not disseminated on a regular basis; \n \n\u25cf\nchanges in market interest rates that may cause purchasers of our shares to demand a different yield;\n\u25cf\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies; \n\u25cf\nmarket reaction to any additional equity, debt or other securities that we may issue in the future, and which may or may not dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders; \n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel; \n\u25cf\nactions by institutional or significant stockholders; \n\u25cf\nshort interest in our securities and the market response to such short interest;\n\u25cf\ndramatic increase or decrease in the number of individual holders of our Common Stock and their participation in social media platforms targeted at speculative investing;\n\u25cf\nspeculation in the press or investment community about our company or industry; \n\u25cf\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or other investments; \n\u25cf\nlegislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting our business, our industry, including positions taken by the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d); \n\u25cf\nstrategic actions taken by motion picture studios such as changes to the number of films to be released theatrically or the shuffling of film release dates;\n\u25cf\ninvestigations, proceedings, or litigation that involve or affect us; \n\u25cf\nthe occurrence of any of the other risk factors included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K; and \n\u25cf\ngeneral market and economic conditions. \nNegative sentiment among AMC\u2019s retail stockholder base could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our Common Stock and your investment therein.\n\u200b\nSome of our retail investors have referred to themselves as \u201cApes\u201d on social media and in other forums. Self-proclaimed \u201cApes\u201d are widely viewed as playing a significant role in the market dynamics that have resulted in substantial increases and volatility in the market prices of our Common Stock and other so-called \u201cmeme\u201d stocks. While AMC and its management have actively sought to foster positive relationships with its significant retail stockholder base as the owners of AMC, and while AMC\u2019s retail stockholder base has been credited favorably with assisting AMC in raising significant capital in the past, there is no guarantee that AMC will be able to continue to benefit from support from its retail stockholder base in the future. Negative investor sentiment could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our Common Stock.\n\u200b\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInformation available in public media that is published by third parties, including blogs, articles, online forums, message boards and social and other media may include statements not attributable to the Company and may not be reliable or accurate.\n\u200b\nWe have received, and may continue to receive, a high degree of media coverage that is published or otherwise disseminated by third parties, including blogs, articles, online forums, message boards and social and other media. This includes coverage that is not attributable to statements made by our directors, officers or employees. You should read carefully, evaluate and rely only on the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed on September 29, 2023, the prospectus supplement filed November 9, 2023, the accompanying prospectus or any applicable free writing prospectus or incorporated documents filed with the SEC in determining whether to purchase our shares of Common Stock. Information provided by third parties may not be reliable or accurate and could materially impact the trading price of our Common Stock which could cause losses to your investments.\nFuture offerings of debt, which would be senior to our Common Stock upon liquidation, and/or other preferred equity securities, which may be senior to our Common Stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation, could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\n \nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including convertible or non-convertible senior or subordinated notes, convertible or non-convertible preferred stock, medium-term notes and trust preferred securities, to raise cash or bolster our liquidity, to repay, refinance, redeem or repurchase indebtedness (including expenses, accrued interest and premium, if any), for working capital, to finance strategic initiatives and future acquisitions or for other purposes. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our Common Stock. In addition, any additional preferred stock we may issue could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on distribution payments that could limit our ability to make a distribution to the holders of our Common Stock. Since our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings potentially reducing the market price of our Common Stock. \nAnti-takeover protections in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage or prevent a takeover of our Company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third-party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u25cf\na classified board of directors;\n\u25cf\nthe sole power of a majority of the board of directors to fix the number of directors;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u25cf\nthe sole power of the board of directors to fill any vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u25cf\nthe ability of our board of directors to designate one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and\n\u25cf\nthe inability of stockholders to call special meetings.\nOur issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares. As of February 21, 2024, 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock are authorized and available for issuance.\n33\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur incorporation under Delaware law, the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock or a stockholder rights plan and certain other provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving our company or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our Common Stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our Common Stock.\nAn issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the Common Stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our Common Stock.\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.\nIn addition, the issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our Common Stock by making an investment in the Common Stock less attractive. For example, investors may not wish to purchase Common Stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase Common Stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of Common Stock.\nIncreases in market interest rates may cause potential investors to seek higher returns and therefore reduce demand for our Common Stock, which could result in a decline in the market price of our Common Stock.\nOne of the factors that may influence the price of our Common Stock is the return on our Common Stock (i.e., the amount of distributions or price appreciation as a percentage of the price of our Common Stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our Common Stock to expect a return, which we may be unable or choose not to provide. Further, higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease the cash available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline.\n\u200b\nItem\u00a0\n1B.  Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone.\nItem\u00a0\n1C.  Cybersecurity.\nRisk Management and Strategy\nThe Company recognizes the importance of developing, implementing, and maintaining cybersecurity measures to assess, identify, and manage material risks from cybersecurity (including cybersecurity threats associated with the use of third-party service providers), to safeguard our information systems, and to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data on our information systems.\nManaging Material Risks & Integrated Overall Risk Management\nThe Company has strategically integrated cybersecurity risk management into our broader risk management framework. Management has formed cross-functional risk and information security committees (the \u201cSecurity Committees\u201d) to initiate, develop, review and implement cybersecurity policies, procedures and training to mitigate cybersecurity risks. Our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) cybersecurity leadership team works closely with our Security Committees and internal audit team to evaluate and address cybersecurity risks in alignment with our business objectives and operational needs.\nRisk Management Personnel\nThe Company\u2019s senior IT leadership, comprised of the Chief Information Officers of both AMC and Odeon, and IT cybersecurity teams have the primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring, and managing, our cybersecurity programs. The Company\u2019s senior IT leadership bring over fifty years of combined IT experience to their roles. Each \n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nmember of the Company\u2019s IT cybersecurity leadership team, comprised of the AMC Sr. Director Cybersecurity and Network, the AMC Director Cybersecurity, the Odeon Group Head of Cyber, Risk and Operations and the AMC VP IT Operations, brings 20+ years of IT experience. The Company regularly invests in training on these teams, and key leadership positions hold CISSP certifications. Our senior IT leadership and IT cybersecurity team, with input as appropriate from the Security Committees, oversee our governance programs, tests our compliance with standards, remediate known risks, and direct employee training.\nMonitoring Cybersecurity Incidents\nThe Security Committees are continually informed about the latest developments in cybersecurity, including potential threats and risk management techniques. The Security Committees, and in particular senior IT leadership, IT cybersecurity and internal audit members serving on the Security Committees, implement and oversee processes for the regular monitoring of our information systems. The Company follows the NIST framework to design and implement security processes, tools and procedures, and regular system audits identify and lead to remediation of potential vulnerabilities. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, senior IT leadership and the Security Committees are equipped with a well-defined incident response plan. This plan includes immediate actions to mitigate the impact, internal and external communication plans, and notification requirements.\nEngagement of Consultants for Risk Management Services\nRecognizing the complexity and evolving nature of cybersecurity threats, the Company engages with a range of external experts to perform a variety of functions for the Company. These include, but are not limited to, cybermaturity audits, targeted ransomware assessment and table-top exercises, red and purple team attack simulations, internal penetration tests and other internal and external audits. These partnerships enable us to leverage specialized knowledge and insights into our cybersecurity strategies and processes. \nOverseeing Third-Party Risk\nBecause we are aware of the risks associated with third-party service providers, the Company implements processes to oversee and manage these risks. The Company utilizes software products and services to monitor and protect the Company\u2019s environment from possible third-party breaches impacting the Company\u2019s environment. This approach is designed to mitigate risks related to data breaches or other security incidents originating from third-parties. Third-parties who have access to highly sensitive information due to services performed and data retained are subject to increased scrutiny.\nRisks from Cybersecurity Threats \nWe have not experienced any cybersecurity incidents that we believe have materially affected, or are likely to materially affect, the Company.\nGovernance\nBoard of Directors and Audit Committee Oversight\nOur board of directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) understands the critical nature of managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats. The Board has established robust oversight mechanisms to ensure effective governance in managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats.\nThe audit committee of the Board (the \u201cAudit Committee\u201d) is central to the Board\u2019s oversight of cybersecurity risks and bears the primary responsibility for overseeing these risks. Senior IT leadership regularly informs the Audit Committee, the Chief Financial Officer and other members of the Company\u2019s senior leadership of cybersecurity risks and incidents. This ensures that the highest levels of management are kept abreast of the cybersecurity posture and potential risks facing the Company.\nManagement\u2019s Role Managing Risk\nSenior IT leadership play a pivotal role in managing cybersecurity risk and keeping the Audit Committee apprised of cybersecurity developments. Senior IT leadership provide comprehensive briefings to the Audit Committee on a periodic basis. These briefings encompass a broad range of topics, including:\n\u25cf\ncurrent cybersecurity landscape and emerging threats;\n\u25cf\nstatus of ongoing cybersecurity initiatives and strategies;\n35\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\nlearnings from any cybersecurity events; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards.\nIn addition to our scheduled meetings, the Audit Committee and senior IT leadership maintain an ongoing dialogue regarding emerging or potential cybersecurity risks. The Company, at the direction of the Audit Committee, conducts periodic reviews of the Company\u2019s cybersecurity posture and the effectiveness of its risk management strategies. These reviews help in identifying areas for improvement and ensuring the alignment of cybersecurity efforts with the overall risk management framework. \n\u200b\nItem\u00a0\n2.  \nProperties.\nThe following table sets forth the general character and ownership classification of our theatre circuit, excluding non-consolidated joint ventures and managed theatres, as of December\u00a031, 2023:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nProperty\u00a0Holding\u00a0Classification\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nTheatres\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nScreens\n\u00a0\nOwned\n\u00a0\n 35\n\u00a0\n 352\n\u200b\nLeased\n\u00a0\n 798\n\u00a0\n 9,387\n\u200b\nTotal\n\u00a0\n 833\n\u00a0\n 9,739\n\u200b\n\u200b\nWe lease our corporate headquarters in Leawood, Kansas.

Our Common Stock has traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the \u201cNYSE\u201d) since December\u00a018, 2013 under the symbol \u201cAMC\u201d.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Part I on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to these statements. See Note\u00a01\n\u2014\nThe Company and Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 thereof for information regarding the Company\u2019s significant accounting policies.\nOverview\nAMC is the world\u2019s largest theatrical exhibition company and an industry leader in innovation and operational excellence. As of December 31, 2023 we operated in 11 countries including the United States and throughout Europe. \nOur theatrical exhibition revenues are generated primarily from box office admissions and food and beverage sales. The balance of our revenues is generated from ancillary sources, including on-screen advertising, fees earned from our customer loyalty programs, rental of theatre auditoriums, income from gift card and exchange ticket sales, theatrical distribution, retail popcorn sales, and online ticketing fees. As of December\u00a031, 2023, we owned, operated or had interests in 898 theatres and 10,059 screens.\nSignificant Events\u2014For the Year Ended December\u00a031, 2023\nAMC Distribution. \nDuring 2023 we, along with our sub-distribution partners, served as the theatrical distributor for two theatrical releases: \nTAYLOR SWIFT | THE ERAS TOUR\n and \nRENAISSANCE: A FILM BY BEYONC\u00c9. \nThe distribution business is a new source of revenue that we have the potential to capitalize on in the future. \nLease Termination\n. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company received a $13.0 million buyout incentive from a landlord which provided the landlord the right to terminate the lease of one theatre. The incentive and termination gain resulted in a $16.7 million reduction to rent expense. \nSaudi Cinema Company. \nOn December 30, 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our 10.0% investment in Saudi Cinema Company, LLC for SAR 112.5 million ($30.0 million), subject to certain closing conditions. On January 24, 2023, the Saudi Ministry of Commerce recorded a sale of equity and we received the proceeds on January 25, 2023. We recorded a gain on the sale of $15.5 million in investment income during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nDebt Repurchases & Exchanges. \nThe below table summarizes the cash debt repurchase transactions during the year ended December 31, 2023, including related party transactions with Antara, which was a related party from February 7, 2023 to August 25, 2023.

On February 7, 2023, we issued 19,762,130 AMC Preferred Equity Units to Antara in exchange for $75.1 million in cash and $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 10%/12% Cash/PIK Toggle Second Lien Notes due 2026. We recorded $193.7 million to stockholders\u2019 deficit as a result of the transaction. We paid $1.4 million of accrued interest in cash upon exchange of the notes.\nShare Issuances.\n During the year ended December 31, 2023, we entered into various equity distribution agreements with sales agents to sell shares of our Common Stock and AMC Preferred Equity Units, from time to time, through \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering programs that have been completed. \nDuring the year ended December\u00a0\n31, 2023, the Company raised gross proceeds of approximately $790.0 million and paid fees to  sales agents and incurred other third-party issuance costs of approximately $19.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively, through its at-the-market offering of approximately 88.0 million shares of its Common Stock and 7.1 million of its AMC Preferred Equity Units. The Company paid $12.6 million of other third-party issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 9\u2014Stockholders\u2019 Deficit for further information regarding the at-the-market offerings.\nSpecial Awards. \nOn February 23, 2023, AMC\u2019s Board of Directors approved special awards in lieu of vesting of the 2022 PSU awards. The special awards were accounted for as a modification to the 2022 PSU awards which lowered the Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow performance targets such that 200% vesting was achieved for both tranches. This modification resulted in the immediate additional vesting of 238,959 Common Stock 2022 PSUs and 238,959 AMC Preferred Equity Unit 2022 PSUs. This was treated as a Type 3 modification (improbable-to-probable) which requires us to recognize additional stock compensation expense based on the modification date fair values of the Common Stock PSUs and AMC Preferred Equity Units PSUs of $14.9 million and $5.3 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $20.2 million of additional stock compensation expense related to these awards.\nNCM Bankruptcy. \nOn April 11, 2023, National CineMedia, LLC (\u201cNCM\u201d) filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Texas. NCM is the in-theatre advertising provider for the majority of our theatres in the United States. Under the Chapter 11 Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), NCM has assumed its agreements with us. As part of the Plan, on August 7, 2023, NCM issued 16,581,829 common units that were owed to AMC as part of the annual common unit adjustment. But under the terms of the Plan and the restructuring of the equity of NCM thereunder, the NCM common units were immediately cancelled upon the efficacy of the Plan. We have filed appeals with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, objecting to, among other things, certain terms of the Plan, including modification of the terms of the exhibitor services agreement with other parties that were not granted to us and appeal of the court\u2019s order to approve cancellation of the NCM common unit issuance. We do not expect the NCM bankruptcy to have a material impact on the Company. \nShareholder Litigation. \nTwo putative stockholder class actions were filed in the Delaware Chancery Court that assert a breach of fiduciary duty against certain of our directors and a claim for breach of \n8\n \nDel. C\n. \u00a7 242 against those directors and us, arising out of our creation of AMC Preferred Equity Units, the transactions between Antara and us that we announced on December 22, 2022, and the Charter Amendments.\n41\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThis litigation prevented us from immediately implementing the Charter Amendments. On April 2, 2023, the parties entered into a binding settlement term sheet to settle the litigation and allow implementation of the Charter Amendments. On August 11, 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court approved the settlement and on Monday, August 21, 2023, the Delaware Supreme Court confirmed the ruling of the Chancery Court. Pursuant to the settlement term sheet, record holders of Common Stock at the close of business on August 24, 2023, after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split, but prior to the conversion of AMC Preferred Equity Units into Common Stock, received a payment of one share of Common Stock for every 7.5 shares of Common Stock owned by the Settlement Payment Recipients. On August 28, 2023, the Company made the Settlement Payment and issued 6,897,018 shares of Common Stock. See Note 11\u2014Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of Part II of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the litigation and settlement. For capitalized terms used herein but not defined see Note 9\u2014Stockholders\u2019 Deficit in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof.\nSignificant Events\u2014For the Year Ended December\u00a031, 2022\nShare Issuances. \nOn September 26, 2022, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (the \u201cEquity Distribution Agreement\u201d) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as a sales agent (\u201cSales Agent\u201d), to sell up to 42.5 million shares, as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split, of our AMC Preferred Equity Units, from time to time, through an \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering program. We raised gross proceeds of approximately $228.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, through our at-the-market offering of approximately 20.8 million shares, as adjusted for the Reverse Stock Split, of our AMC Preferred Equity Units and paid fees to the Sales Agent and incurred other third-party issuance costs of approximately $5.7 million and $5.5 million, respectively. \nAMC Preferred Equity Units.\n On August 4, 2022, we announced that the Board of Directors declared a special dividend of one AMC Preferred Equity Unit for each share of Class A common stock outstanding at the close of business on August 15, 2022, the record date. The dividend was paid at the close of business on August 19, 2022 to investors who held Class A common stock as of August 22, 2022, the ex-dividend date. Each AMC Preferred Equity Unit was a depositary share and represents an interest in a share of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock evidenced by a depositary receipt pursuant to a deposit agreement. Each AMC Preferred Equity Unit was designed to have the same economic and voting rights as a share of Common Stock. Trading of the AMC Preferred Equity Units on the NYSE began on August 22, 2022 under the ticker symbol \u201cAPE\u201d and ceased on August 25, 2023. \nInvestment in Hycroft. \nOn March 14, 2022, we purchased 2.3 million units of Hycroft Mining Holding Corporation (NASDAQ: HYMC) (\u201cHycroft\u201d) for $27.9 million, with each unit consisting of one common share of Hycroft and one common share purchase warrant. The units were priced at $11.93 per unit. The preceding amounts have been adjusted for the one-for-ten reverse stock split Hycroft effectuated on November 15, 2023. \nEach warrant we hold is exercisable for one common share of Hycroft at a price of $10.680 per share over a 5-year term through March 2027. We account for the common shares of Hycroft under the equity method and we have elected the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825-10. We account for the warrants as derivatives in accordance with ASC 815. Accordingly, the fair value of the investments in Hycroft are remeasured at each subsequent reporting period and unrealized gains and losses are reported in investment expense (income). During the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company recorded unrealized losses related to the investment in Hycroft of $12.6 million and $6.3 million, respectively, in investment expense (income), respectively. See Note 12\u2014Fair Value Measurements in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information.\nFirst Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2029.\n On February 14, 2022, we issued $950.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.5% First Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (\u201cFirst Lien Notes due 2029\u201d). We used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes, and cash on hand, to fund the full redemption of the $500 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes due 2025, the $300 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes due 2026, and $73.5 million aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Toggle notes due 2026 and to pay related accrued interest, fees, costs, premiums and expenses. We recorded a loss on debt extinguishment related to this transaction of $135.0 million in other expense in 2022. \n\u200b\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOdeon Debt Refinancing. \nThe Odeon Term Loan Facility was set to mature on August 19, 2023. On October 20, 2022, Odeon Finco PLC, a direct subsidiary of Odeon Cinemas Group Limited (\u201cOCGL\u201d) and an indirect subsidiary of the Company issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 12.75% Odeon Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (\u201cOdeon Notes due 2027\u201d), at an issue price of 92.00%. The Odeon Notes due 2027 bear a cash interest rate of 12.75% per annum and will be payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1, beginning on May 1, 2023. The Odeon Notes due 2027 are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by certain subsidiaries of Odeon and by Holdings on a standalone and unsecured basis. The Odeon Notes due 2027 contain covenants that limit Odeon and certain subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness; (ii) create liens; (iii) declare or pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; (iv) make investments; (v) enter into transaction with affiliates; (vi) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their respective assets; and (vii) impair the security interest in the collateral. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions. We used the $363.0 million net proceeds from the Odeon Notes due 2027 and $146.7 million of existing cash to fund the payment in full of the \u00a3147.6 million ($167.7) million and \u20ac312.2 million ($308.9) million aggregate principal amounts of the Odeon Term Loan Facility and to pay related accrued interest, fees, costs, premiums and expenses. We recorded a loss on debt extinguishment related to this transaction of $36.5 million in other expense in 2022.\nSignificant Events\u2014For the Year Ended December\u00a031, 2021\nFor a discussion of significant events for the year ended December 31, 2021, see \n\u201cPart II, Item 7.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, income tax expense was primarily related to changes in domestic indefinite-lived deferred liabilities and taxes in Finland. During the year ended December 31, 2020, income tax expense was primarily due to the recording of international valuation allowances against deferred tax assets held in Spain of $40.1 million and Germany of $33.1 million, partially offset by income tax benefit from net losses incurred in International markets. During the year ended December 31, 2019, an international valuation allowance previously established against deferred tax assets held in Spain was released in the fourth quarter of 2019 resulting in a $41.5 million benefit to income tax expense. We estimate that we will have no liability for deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.  \n(8)\nIncludes consolidated theatres only.\n\u200b\n47\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material. We have identified several policies as being critical because they require management to make particularly difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and there is a likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. \nAll of our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note\u00a01\n\u2014\nThe Company and Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 thereof.\nLong-lived Assets Impairments.\n  We review long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. \nCritical estimates.\n There are many estimates and significant judgments that are made by management in performing impairment evaluations of long-lived assets, including but not limited to, estimates of future attendance, revenues, operating costs and expenses, capital expenditures, the cost of capital. These estimates determine whether impairments have been incurred and quantify the amount of any related impairment charge. \nAssumptions and judgment.\n Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future cash flows. Our projections assume that operating revenues will continue to gradually improve to the point of approaching pre-COVID-19 levels. This assumption, together with other assumptions, create considerable amount of management judgment with respect to cash flow estimates and appropriate discount rates to be used in determining the fair value of long-lived assets. \nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions\n. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates, many of which fall under Level 3 within the fair value measurement hierarchy. Factors that could lead to impairment of long-lived assets include adverse industry or economic trends that would result in declines in the operating performance of our Domestic and International Theatres. Examples of adverse events or circumstances that could change include (i) limited availability of new theatrical releases; (ii) an adverse change in macroeconomic conditions; (iii) increased cost factors that have a negative effect on our earnings and cash flows and higher interest rates; and (iv) negative or overall declining financial performance compared with our actual and projected results of relevant prior periods.\nIf we are required to record an impairment charge it may substantially reduce the carrying value of our assets and reduce our income in the year in which it is recorded. Given the nature of our business and our recent history, business conditions that are constantly changing, and the competitive business environment in which we operate future material impairments are possible and they may be material.\nOur Current Long-lived Asset Impairment related Estimates and Changes in those Estimates\n. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment charges related to our long-lived assets of $49.2 million on 68 theatres in the U.S. markets with 738 screens which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net and $57.7 million on 57 theatres in the International markets with 488 screens which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded non-cash impairment charges related to our long-lived assets of $73.4 million on 68 theatres in the U.S. markets with 817 screens which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net and $59.7 million on 53 theatres in the International markets with 456 screens which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded non-cash impairment charges related to our long-lived assets of $61.3 million on 77 theatres in the U.S. markets with 805 screens which were related to property, net, operating \n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\nlease right-of-use assets, net and other long-term assets and $15.9 million on 14 theatres in the International Markets with 118 screens which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net.\nAt December 31, 2023, related cash flows were discounted at 9.0% for the Domestic Theatres and 11.0% for the International Theatres. At December 31, 2022, related cash flows were discounted at 10.0% for Domestic Theatres and 12.5% for International Theatres. At December 31, 2021, related cash flows were discounted at 10.0% for Domestic Theatres and 11.5% for International Theatres.\nGoodwill.\u00a0\nWe evaluate the goodwill recorded at our two reporting units (Domestic Theatres and International Theatres) for impairment annually as of the beginning of the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate. Impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as a goodwill impairment charge, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Entities are allowed to perform optional qualitative assessments for both reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.\nCritical estimates\n. Calculating the fair value of our Domestic Theatres and International Theatres reporting units by use of the income approach for enterprise valuation methodology which utilizes estimated future discounted cash flows. The income approach provides an estimate of fair value by measuring estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period and applying a present value discount rate to the cash flows. The present value of the cash flows is then added to the present value equivalent of the residual value of the business to arrive at an estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The residual value represents the present value of the projected cash flows beyond the discrete projection period. The discount rates are determined using weighted average cost of capital for the risk of achieving the projected cash flows. \nWe have elected to perform the optional qualitative assessment during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. Inherent in the qualitative assessment are estimates and assumptions about our consideration of events and circumstances that may indicate a potential impairment. Such estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, industry and market conditions, expected cost pressures, expected financial performance, and general macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, the estimated fair value of our debt and equity at the consolidated level may be a relevant factor in determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. \nAssumptions and judgment\n. Estimating the impact of the general macroeconomic conditions, potential cost pressures, and future industry and market conditions requires significant judgement. We must make assumptions around how much weight should be given to each event and circumstance in order to make an overall qualitative assessment on whether it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. The estimated fair value of our debt is based on observable market based inputs and the estimated fair value of our equity is based on quoted prices in active markets.\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions\n. If we were required to record an impairment charge to our goodwill it may substantially reduce the carrying value of goodwill on our balance sheet and reduce our income in the year in which it is recorded. Given the nature of our business and our recent history, business conditions that are constantly changing, and the competitive business environment in which we operate future material impairments are possible and they may be material.\nOur Current Goodwill Estimates and Changes in those Estimates\n. Based on our qualitative assessments for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we do not believe it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired.  \nIncome and operating taxes.\n \nIncome and operating taxes are inherently difficult to estimate and record. This is due to the complex nature of the U.S. and International tax codes and also because our returns are routinely subject to examination by government tax authorities, including federal, state and local officials. Most of these examinations take place a few years after we have filed our tax returns. Our tax audits in many instances raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, the timing and amount of deductions claimed and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. \nCritical estimates\n. In calculating our effective income tax rate and other taxes applicable to our operations, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions with disparate tax laws.\n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAssumptions and judgment\n. We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, based on our interpretation of local tax laws. We also inventory, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and record liabilities for the amount of such positions that may not be sustained, or may only be partially sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities.\nImpact if actual results differ from assumptions\n. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.\nOur Current Tax Estimates and Changes in those Estimates\n. At December\u00a031, 2023, our federal income tax loss carryforwards were approximately $1,711.9\u00a0million, our state income tax loss carryforwards were approximately $2,463.3\u00a0million, and our foreign income tax loss carryforwards were approximately $949.0 million. Since these losses have varying degrees of carryforward periods, it requires us to estimate the amount of carryforward losses that we can reasonably be expected to realize. Future changes in conditions and in the tax code may change these strategies and thus change the amount of carry forward losses that we expect to realize and the amount of valuation allowances we have recorded. As of December 31, 2023, we had a total valuation allowance of $1,641.3 million related to the above loss carryforward and other future tax benefits for which realization is not likely to occur. Accordingly, future reported results could be materially impacted by changes in tax matters, positions, rules and estimates and these changes could be material.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) plus (i) income tax provision (benefit), (ii) interest expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance and to include attributable EBITDA from equity investments in theatre operations in International markets and any cash distributions of earnings from other equity method investees. These further adjustments are itemized below. You are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. The preceding definition of and adjustments made to GAAP measures to determine Adjusted EBITDA are broadly consistent with Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Company\u2019s debt indentures.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings (loss) as an indicator of operating performance (as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have included Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides management and investors with additional information to measure our performance and estimate our value.\nAdjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S.\u00a0GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA:\n\u25cf\ndoes not reflect our capital expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\n\u25cf\ndoes not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n\u25cf\ndoes not reflect the significant interest expenses, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt;\n\u25cf\nexcludes income tax payments that represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n\u25cf\ndoes not reflect any cash requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. markets was $370.2 million compared to $59.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by an increase in attendance as a result of the popularity of new film releases, increases in food and beverage sales per patron, increases in average ticket price, increases in other revenues, and decreases in rent expense. These improvements were partially offset by increases in operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA in the International markets was $55.6 million compared to $(13.0) million during the year ended December 31, 2022. The year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by an increase in attendance as a result of the popularity of new film releases, increases in average ticket price, increases in food and beverage sales per patron. These improvements were partially offset by a decline in gift card and package ticket expirations and theatre rentals for meetings, decreases in government assistance, and increases in rent, operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Adjusted EBITDA in the U.S. markets and International markets was $425.8 million compared to $46.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, driven by the aforementioned factors impacting Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe following tables set forth our Adjusted EBITDA by reportable operating segment and our reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended \nAdjusted EBITDA (In millions)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2022\nU.S. markets\n\u200b\n$\n 370.2\n\u200b\n$\n 59.6\nInternational markets\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 55.6\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (13.0)\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n\u200b\n$\n 425.8\n\u200b\n$\n 46.6\n\u200b\n\u200b\n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n(In\u00a0millions)\n\u200b\nDecember 31, 2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember 31, 2022\nNet loss\n\u200b\n$\n (396.6)\n\u200b\n$\n (973.6)\nPlus:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n (1)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 3.4\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2.5\nInterest expense\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 411.2\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 378.7\nDepreciation and amortization\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 365.0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 396.0\nImpairment of long-lived assets, definite and indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill\n (2)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 106.9\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 133.1\nCertain operating expense\n (3)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2.5\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 8.0\nEquity in (earnings) loss of non-consolidated entities \n(4)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (7.7)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1.6\nCash distributions from non-consolidated entities\n (5)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 6.5\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 6.6\nAttributable EBITDA \n(6)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 2.2\n\u200b\n\u200b\n 0.4\nInvestment expense (income)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (15.5)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 14.9\nOther expense (income) \n(7)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n (61.3)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 80.4\nOther non-cash rent benefit \n(8)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (35.0)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (26.6)\nGeneral and administrative \u2014 unallocated:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nMerger, acquisition and other costs\n (9)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 1.7\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 2.1\nStock-based compensation expense\n (10)\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 42.5\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n 22.5\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\u200b\n$\n 425.8\n\u200b\n$\n 46.6\n(1)\nFor information regarding the income tax provision (benefit), see Note 10\n\u2014\nIncome Taxes in the Notes \nto the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 thereof. \n \n(2)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment charges related to our long-lived assets of $49.2 million on 68 theatres in the U.S. markets with 738 screens which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net and $57.7 million on 57 theatres in the International markets with 488 screens which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded non-cash impairment charges related to our long-lived assets of $73.4 million on 68 theatres in the U.S. markets with 817 screens which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net and $59.7 million on 53 theatres in the International markets with 456 screens which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net.\n(3)\nAmounts represent preopening expense related to temporarily closed screens under renovation, theatre and other closure expense for the permanent closure of screens including the related accretion of interest, non-cash deferred digital equipment rent expense, and disposition of assets and other non-operating gains or losses included in operating expenses.

Admissions revenues increased $489.1 million, or 22.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to an increase in attendance of 19.2% from 201.0 million patrons to 239.5 million patrons and a 2.6% increase in average ticket price. The increase in attendance was primarily due to the popularity of film product compared to the prior year. The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to higher ticket prices for TAYLOR SWIFT | THE ERAS TOUR and RENAISSANCE: A FILM BY BEYONC\u00c9 and increased attendance for 3D content, partially offset by higher frequency of use by subscribers to A-List.\nFood and beverage revenues increased $356.1 million, or 27.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the increase in attendance and an increase in food and beverage per patron. Food and beverage per patron increased 6.6% from $6.54 to $6.97 due primarily to an increase in average prices, the percentage of guests making transactions, and the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions on the sale of food and beverage in certain international markets, partially offset by lower units purchased per transaction and higher frequency from our Stubs loyalty members.\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nTotal other theatre revenues increased $56.0 million, or 14.1%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to higher ticket fees due to the increase in the number of tickets purchased online, increases in distribution revenues from TAYLOR SWIFT | THE ERAS TOUR and RENAISSANCE: A FILM BY BEYONC\u00c9, and increases in advertising and retail sales, partially offset by lower income from gift cards and package tickets and lower income from theatre meetings.\nOperating costs and expenses.\u00a0\nOperating costs and expenses increased $453.2 million, or 10.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily due to increases in film exhibition and food and beverage costs. Film exhibition costs increased $239.4 million, or 22.8%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the increase in attendance. As a percentage of admissions revenues, film exhibition costs were 48.0% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 47.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022. \nFood and beverage costs increased $86.7 million, or 37.9%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in food and beverage costs was primarily due to the increase in food and beverage revenues and increases in product costs and obsolescence. As a percentage of food and beverage revenues, food and beverage costs were 18.9% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 17.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOperating expense increased by $163.1 million, or 10.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in operating expense was primarily due to an increase in attendance and film distribution costs. As a percentage of revenues, operating expense was 35.1% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 39.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022. Rent expense decreased 1.4%, or $12.7 million, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, due primarily to the early termination of one theatre lease for a benefit of $16.7 million, which included an early termination payment from the landlord for $13.0 million. See Note 3\u2014Leases in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II Item 8 thereof for further information on the impact of COVID-19 on leases and rent obligations of approximately $56.3 million that have been deferred to future years as of December 31, 2023.\u200b\nMerger, acquisition, and other costs.\u00a0\nMerger, acquisition, and other costs were $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to $2.1\u00a0million during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nOther.\u00a0\nOther general and administrative expense increased $34.3 million, or 16.5%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 due primarily to stock-based compensation expense of $20.2 million related to a February 23, 2023 special award grant accounted for as a modification to the 2022 PSU awards which lowered the Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow performance targets such that 200% vesting was achieved for both tranches and increased payroll, legal, professional and consulting and computer maintenance costs. The modification resulted in the immediate additional vesting of 238,959 Common Stock PSUs and 238,959 Preferred Equity Unit PSUs. The modification was treated as a Type 3 modification (improbable to probable) which required us to recognize additional stock compensation expense based on the modification date fair values of the Common Stock PSUs and AMC Preferred Equity Unit PSUs of $62.30 per unit and $22.20 per unit, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2023.

primarily due to lower depreciation expense on theatres impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022, partially offset by accelerated depreciation related to the replacement of digital projectors and permanently closed theatres.\nImpairment of long-lived assets.  \u00a0\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized non-cash impairment losses of $49.2 million on 68 theatres in the

($7.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a loss of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease in equity losses from the prior year is primarily related to our 10.0% interest in Saudi Cinema Company, LLC that was sold on January 24, 2023.\n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInvestment (income) expense.\u00a0\nInvestment income was $(15.5) million for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to investment expense of $14.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.

Film exhibition costs increased $47.5 million, or 21.6%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the increase in attendance. As a percentage of admissions revenues, film exhibition costs were 39.7% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to 39.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFood and beverage costs increased $17.9 million, or 28.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2022.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022\n, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2023, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n\u200b\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\u2014For the Year Ended December 31, 2023, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2022\n\u200b\nOur revenues are primarily collected in cash, principally through admissions and food and beverage sales. We have an operating \u201cfloat\u201d which partially financed our operations and which generally permitted us to maintain a smaller amount of working capital capacity. This float existed because admissions revenues are received in cash, while exhibition costs (primarily film rentals) are ordinarily paid to distributors from 20 to 45\u00a0days following receipt of admissions revenues. Film distributors generally release the films which they anticipate will be the most successful during the summer and year-end holiday seasons. Consequently, we typically generate higher revenues during such periods and experience higher working capital requirements following such periods.\nWe had working capital deficits (excluding restricted cash) as of December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022 of $(456.4)\u00a0million and $(811.1)\u00a0million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, working capital \n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nincluded operating lease liabilities of $508.8 million and $567.3 million, respectively, and deferred revenues of $421.8\u00a0million and $402.7 million, respectively. \nSee Note 8\n\u2014\nCorporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for further discussion of our Financial Covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $884.3 million compared to $631.5 million as of December 31, 2022. \nWe have continued to lower our future interest expense through purchases of debt below par value and debt exchanges for equity and enhanced liquidity through equity issuances. See Note 8\n\u2014\nCorporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities, Note 9\n\u2014\nStockholders\u2019 Deficit, and Note 16\u2014Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for further information. We expect, at any time and from time to time, to continue to seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material and, to the extent equity is used, dilutive.\nWe believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and satisfy our obligations currently and through the next twelve months. We are subject to a minimum liquidity requirement of $100.0 million as a condition to the financial covenant suspension period under the Credit Agreement. We believe we will comply with the minimum liquidity requirement through the current maturity date of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility on April 22, 2024. We currently do not expect to extend such maturity or replace the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility upon maturity, although we may seek to replace it in the future. \nOur cash burn rates are not sustainable long-term. In order to achieve sustainable net positive operating cash flows and long-term profitability, we believe that operating revenues will need to increase to levels in line with pre-COVID-19 operating revenues. North America box office grosses were down approximately 21% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Until such time as we are able to achieve positive operating cash flow, it is difficult to estimate our liquidity requirements, future cash burn rates, future operating revenues, and attendance levels. Depending on our assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve levels of operating revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly.\nThere can be no assurance that the operating revenues, attendance levels and other assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements and future cash burn rates will be correct, and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to limited ability to predict studio film release dates, the overall production and theatrical release levels and success of individual titles. Additionally, the effects of labor stoppages, including but not limited to the Writers Guild of America strike and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strike that occurred during 2023, cannot be reasonably estimated and are expected to have a negative impact in 2024 on the future film slate for exhibition, the Company\u2019s future liquidity and cash burn rates. Further, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in generating the additional liquidity necessary to meet our obligations beyond twelve months from the issuance of this Annual Report on terms acceptable to us or at all. \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\u200b\nNet cash used in operating activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, were $215.2\u00a0million and $628.5\u00a0million during the years ended December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, respectively. The improvement in cash flows used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase in attendance and decrease in net loss, and reductions in rent repayments for rent that was deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increases in working capital used and cash interest paid. See Note 3\u2014Leases in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof for a summary of the estimated future repayment terms for the remaining $56.3 million of rentals that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\u200b\nNet cash used in investing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, were $180.1\u00a0million and $224.0\u00a0million during the years ended December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, respectively. Cash outflows from investing activities for capital expenditures during the years ended December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022 were $225.6\u00a0million and $202.0\u00a0million, respectively. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, cash flows used in investing activities also included proceeds from the sale of our investment in Saudi Cinema Company, LLC of $30.0 million and proceeds from the disposition of long-term assets of $16.5, offset by outflows for the acquisition of theatre assets of $4.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, cash flows used in investing activities included investment in Hycroft common stock for $25.0 million, investment in Hycroft warrants for $2.9 million, acquisition of theatre assets for $17.8 million, partially offset by proceeds from the disposition of long-term assets of $11.3 million and proceeds of $13.0 million from the sale of securities in conjunction with the liquidation of a non-qualified deferred compensation plan.\nWe fund the costs of constructing, maintaining and remodeling our theatres through existing cash balances, cash generated from operations, landlord contributions, or borrowed funds, as necessary. We generally lease our theatres pursuant to long-term non-cancelable operating leases, which may require the developer who owns the property, to reimburse us for the construction costs. We estimate that our cash outflows for capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions, will be approximately $175 million to $225 million for the year ending December 31, 2024 to maintain and enhance operations.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n\u200b\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, were $649.3\u00a0million and $(91.3)\u00a0million, during the years ended December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, respectively. The increase in cash flows provided by in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022 was primarily due to equity issuances of $832.7, net of issuance costs, partially offset by the repurchase of Second Lien Notes due 2026 for $139.9 million, scheduled principal payments under the Term Loan due 2026 of $20.0 million, and taxes paid for restricted unit withholdings of $14.2 million. See Note 8\u2014Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities and Note 9\u2014Stockholders\u2019 Deficit in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof for further information, including a summary of principal payments required and maturities of corporate borrowings as of December 31, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, principal and premium payments under the First Lien Notes due 2025 of $534.5 million, principal and premium payments under the First Lien Notes due 2026 of $325.6 million, principal and premium payments under the First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 of $88.1 million, taxes for restricted unit withholdings of $52.3 million, repurchase of Second Lien Notes due 2026 of $68.3 million, and cash used to pay for deferred financing costs of $26.1 million, partially offset by the issuance of the First Lien Notes due 2029 of $950.0 million, issuance of the Odeon Senior Secured Notes due 2027 of $368.0 million, and net proceeds from AMC Preferred Equity Unit share issuances of $220.4 million.\nDividends.\n \nSince April 24, 2020, we have been prohibited from making dividend payments in accordance with the covenant suspension conditions in our Credit Agreement. The payment of future dividends after expiration of our covenant suspension conditions is subject to our Board of Directors\u2019 discretion, and dependent on many considerations, including limitations imposed by covenants in the agreements governing our indebtedness, operating results, capital requirements, strategic considerations and other factors. For further information see Note 8\u2014Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof.\n\u200b\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFuture Contractual Obligations\nOur estimated future obligations as of December 31, 2023 include both current and long-term obligations. Our expected material contractual cash requirements over the next twelve months, primarily consist of capital related betterments of $22.3 million, minimum operating lease payments of $920.3 million, finance lease payments of $8.4 million, contractual cash rent amounts that were due and not paid of $6.4 million recorded in accounts payable, and corporate borrowings principal and interest payments of $25.1 million and $396.6 million, respectively.\nPension funding.\n Our U.S., U.K., and Sweden defined benefit plans are frozen. We fund our U.S. pension plans such that the plans are in compliance with Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) and the plans are not considered \u201cat risk\u201d as defined by ERISA guidelines. We expect to make $5.0 million of contributions to the defined pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nObligation for unrecognized tax benefits.\n As of December\u00a031, 2023, our recorded obligation for unrecognized tax benefits is $5.5\u00a0million. There are currently no unrecognized tax benefits which we anticipate will be resolved in the next twelve months. See Note\u00a010\n\u2014\nIncome Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 thereof for further information.\nMinimum operating lease and finance lease payments. \nWe have current and long-term minimum cash requirements for operating lease payments of $920.3 million and $5,930.0 million, respectively. We have current and long-term minimum cash requirements for finance lease payments of $8.4 million and $76.4 million, respectively. The total amounts do not equal the carrying amount due to imputed interest. We received rent concessions provided by the lessors that aided in mitigating the economic effects of COVID-19 during the pandemic. These concessions primarily consisted of rent abatements and the deferral of rent payments and were included in the amounts above, except for contractual cash rent amounts recorded in accounts payable that were due and not paid of $6.4 million. Our cash expenditures for rent increased significantly in 2022 and 2023 as previously deferred rent payments and landlord concessions started to become current obligations. See Note 3\n\u2014\nLeases in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for a summary of the estimated future repayment terms for the minimum operating lease and finance lease amounts, including the deferred lease amounts due to COVID-19.\nCorporate borrowings principal and interest payments. \nWe have current and long-term cash requirements for the payment of principal related to corporate borrowings of $25.1 million and $4,479.2 million, respectively. The total amount does not equal the carrying amount due to unamortized discounts, premiums and deferred charges. Based upon the December 31, 2023 outstanding principal balances, we have current and long-term cash interest payment requirements related to our corporate borrowings of $396.6 million and $814.3 million, respectively. The cash interest payment requirements for our Senior Secured Term Loans due 2026 was estimated at 8.474% based on the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2023. \nSee Note 8\u2014Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for further information, including a schedule of outstanding principal balances, applicable interest rates, and maturity dates for each individual borrowing and a schedule of required principal payments and maturities of corporate borrowings as of December 31, 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\u2014For the Year Ended December 31, 2022, Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2021\nFor a comparison of our liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, see \n\u201cPart II, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022\n, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2023, which is incorporated herein by reference. \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note\u00a01\n\u2014\nThe Company and Significant Accounting Policies in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part\u00a0II, Item\u00a08 thereof for information regarding recently issued accounting standards.\n\u200b\n64\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem\u00a0\n7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n.\nIn the ordinary course of business, our financial results are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. In accordance with applicable guidance, we presented a sensitivity analysis showing the potential impact to net income of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. For the years ended December\u00a031, 2023 and December 31, 2022, our analysis utilized a hypothetical 100 basis-point increase or decrease to the average interest rate on our variable rate debt instruments to illustrate the potential impact to interest expense of changes in interest rates and a hypothetical 100 basis-point increase or decrease to market interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments to illustrate the potential impact to fair value of changes in interest rates. \nSimilarly, for the same period, our analysis used a uniform and hypothetical 10% increase in foreign currency translation rates to depict the potential impact to net income of changes in foreign currency translation rates. These market risk instruments and the potential impacts to the consolidated statements of operations as presented below.\nMarket risk on variable-rate financial instruments.\n  At December\u00a031, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we maintained Senior Secured Credit Facilities comprised of a $225.0\u00a0million revolving credit facility and $1,905.0\u00a0million of Term Loan due 2026. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement (which governs the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) (as amended through the Thirteenth Amendment to Credit Agreement) bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (1) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) 0.50% per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (b) the prime rate announced by the Administrative Agent and (c) 1.00% per annum plus Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined below) for a 1-month tenor or (2) Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.11448% per annum, 0.26161% per annum, and 0.42826% per annum for interest periods of one-month, three-months, or six-months or longer, respectively (\u201cAdjusted Term SOFR\u201d) plus (x) in the case of the Senior Secured Term Loans, 2.0% for base rate loans or 3.0% for SOFR loans or (y) in the case of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, an applicable margin based on the Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The rate in effect for the outstanding Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026 was 8.474% per annum at December\u00a031, 2023 and 7.274% per annum at December 31, 2022. \nIncreases in market interest rates would cause interest expense to increase and earnings before income taxes to decrease. The change in interest expense and earnings before income taxes would be dependent upon the weighted average outstanding borrowings during the reporting period following an increase in market interest rates. At December 31, 2023, we had no variable-rate borrowings outstanding under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and had an aggregate principal balance of $1,905.0 million outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026. A 100-basis point change in market interest rates would have increased or decreased interest expense on the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026 by $19.1\u00a0million during the year ended December\u00a031, 2023. \nAt December\u00a031, 2022, we had no variable-rate borrowings outstanding under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and had an aggregate principal balance of $1,925.0 million outstanding under the Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026. A 100-basis point change in market interest rates would have increased or decreased interest expense on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities by $19.3\u00a0million during the year ended December\u00a031, 2022. \nMarket risk on fixed-rate financial instruments.\n  Included in long-term corporate borrowings at December\u00a031, 2023 were principal amounts of $950.0 million of our First Lien Notes due 2029, $968.9 million of our Second Lien Notes due 2026, $400.0 million of our Odeon Notes due 2027, $98.3 million of our Notes due 2025, $51.5 million of our Notes due 2026, $125.5 million of our Notes due 2027, and \u00a34.0\u00a0million ($5.1\u00a0million) of our Sterling Notes due 2024. A 100-basis point change in market interest rates would have caused an increase or (decrease) in the fair value of our fixed rate financial instruments of approximately $59.7\u00a0million and $(57.5)\u00a0million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2023.\nIncluded in long-term corporate borrowings at December\u00a031, 2022 were principal amounts of $950.0 million of our First Lien Notes due 2029, $1,389.8 million of our Second Lien Notes due 2026, $400.0 million of our Odeon Notes due 2027, $98.3 million of our Notes due 2025, $55.6 million of our Notes due 2026, $125.5 million of our Notes due 2027, and \u00a34.0 million ($4.8 million) of our Sterling Notes due 2024. A 100-basis point change in market interest rates would have caused an increase or (decrease) in the fair value of our fixed rate financial instruments of approximately $47.5 million and $(45.4) million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\u200b\n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.\n \nWe are also exposed to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates arising from our International markets operations. International markets revenues and operating expenses are transacted in British Pounds, Euros, Swedish Krona and Norwegian Krone. U.S. GAAP requires that our subsidiaries use the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate as their functional currency. If any international subsidiary operates in a highly inflationary economy, U.S. GAAP requires that the U.S. dollar be used as the functional currency. Currency fluctuations in the countries in which we operate result in us reporting exchange gains (losses) or foreign currency translation adjustments. Based upon the functional currencies in the International markets as of December\u00a031, 2023, holding everything else constant, a hypothetical 10% increase in foreign currency translation rates to depict the potential impact to net loss from changes in foreign exchange rates would increase the aggregate net loss of our International theatres for the year ended December 31, 2023 by approximately $10.9 million. Based upon the functional currencies in the International markets as of December\u00a031, 2022, holding everything else constant, a hypothetical 10% increase in foreign currency translation rates to depict the potential impact to net loss of changes in foreign exchange rates would increase the aggregate net loss of our International theatres for the year ended December 31, 2022 by approximately $26.2 million. \nOur foreign currency translation rates increased by approximately 1.0% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023 compared to the year ended December\u00a031, 2022.\n66\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem\u00a0\n8.

With management\u2019s participation, an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was conducted as of December\u00a031, 2023, based on the framework and criteria established in \nInternal Control\u2014Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\u00a031, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report that follows this report.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n/s/ \nAdam M.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes\n\u00a0\u00a0\n(collectively referred to as the \u201cconsolidated financial statements\u201d). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)\n \nand our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\n\u00a0\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the\u00a0consolidated\u00a0financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nDescription of the Matter\n\u200b\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets of $49.2 million and $57.7 million on theatres in the US and International markets, respectively. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Asset groups are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The Company estimates the future undiscounted cash flows to be generated \n68\n\n\nTable of Contents\nby the asset groups and compares those estimates to the carrying value of the related asset groups. If the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the asset group may be impaired. If the asset group is determined to be impaired, the carrying value of the asset group is reduced to fair value as estimated by a discounted cash flow model, with the difference recorded as an impairment charge. \nAuditing management\u2019s long-lived asset impairment analysis was highly judgmental due to the estimation required in determining the undiscounted cash flows and related fair values of an impaired asset group. In particular, the cash flows were sensitive to significant assumptions such as admissions revenue expectations, long term growth rates, and discount rates. \nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\u200b\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company\u2019s assessment of the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by asset groups, and cash flows used to determine fair value for certain asset groups. This included internal controls over management\u2019s review of the significant assumptions underlying the undiscounted cash flow and fair value determination. We also tested management\u2019s controls to validate that the data used in the analysis was complete and accurate. \n\u200b\nTo test the significant assumptions described above, we performed audit procedures that included testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in the analysis. We compared the significant assumptions used by the Company to current industry and economic trends. We performed a sensitivity analysis of the impact of certain assumptions on the estimates and recalculated management\u2019s estimates. We also involved our valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the discount rate used in the fair value estimates.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2020\nKansas City, Missouri\nFebruary 28, 2024\n69\n\n\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\u200b\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control\u2014Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders\u2019 deficit, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023 and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nKansas City, Missouri\nFebruary 28, 2024\n\u200b\n70\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAMC ENTERTAINMENT

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\u200b\nAMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (\u201cHoldings\u201d), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cAMC\u201d), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres located in the United States and Europe. \nStock Split and Reverse Stock Split.\n On August 4, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a special dividend of \none\n AMC Preferred Equity Unit for each share of Class A common stock (\u201cCommon Stock\u201d) outstanding at the close of business August 15, 2022, the record date. The dividend was paid at the close of business August 19, 2022 to investors who held Common Stock as of August 22, 2022, the ex-dividend date. Due to the characteristics of the AMC Preferred Equity Units, the special dividend had the effect of a stock split pursuant to ASC 505-20-25-4. \nOn August 24, 2023, the Company effectuated a reverse stock split at a ratio of \none\n share of Common Stock for every ten shares of Common Stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, each share of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock became convertible into ten shares of Common Stock, and by extension each AMC Preferred Equity Unit became equivalent to \none\n-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock. The reverse stock split did not impact the number of AMC Preferred Equity Units outstanding. The Company concluded that this change in conversion ratio is analogous to a reverse stock split of the AMC Preferred Equity Units even though the reverse stock split did not have an effect on the number of AMC Preferred Equity Units outstanding.\nAccordingly, all references made to share, per share, unit, per unit, or common share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect both the effects of the special dividend as a stock split and the subsequent reverse stock split. References made to AMC Preferred Equity Units have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of the reverse stock split on their equivalent Common Stock shares. \nLiquidity.\n The Company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund its operations and satisfy its obligations currently and through the next twelve months. The Company is subject to a minimum liquidity requirement of $\n100.0\n million as a condition to the financial covenant suspension period under the Credit Agreement. The Company believes it will comply with the minimum liquidity requirement through the current maturity date of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility on April 22, 2024. The Company currently does not expect to extend such maturity or replace the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility upon maturity, although it may seek to replace it in the future. \nThe Company\u2019s cash burn rates are not sustainable long-term. In order to achieve sustainable net positive operating cash flows and long-term profitability, the Company believes that operating revenues will need to increase to levels in line with pre-COVID-19 operating revenues. North America box office grosses were down approximately \n21\n% for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Until such time as the Company is able to achieve positive operating cash flow, it is difficult to estimate the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements, future cash burn rates, future operating revenues, and attendance levels. Depending on the Company\u2019s assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve levels of operating revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly.\nThere can be no assurance that the operating revenues, attendance levels, and other assumptions used to estimate the Company\u2019s liquidity requirements and future cash burn rates will be correct, and the ability to be predictive is uncertain due to limited ability to predict studio film release dates, the overall production and theatrical release levels, and success of individual titles. Additionally, the effects of labor stoppages, including but not limited to the Writers Guild of America strike and the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists strike that occurred during 2023 cannot be reasonably estimated and are expected to have a negative impact in 2024 on the future \n77\n\n\nTable of Contents\nfilm slate for exhibition, the Company\u2019s future liquidity and cash burn rates. Further, there can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in generating the additional liquidity necessary to meet its obligations beyond twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements on terms acceptable to the Company or at all.\nThe Company may, at any time and from time to time, seek to retire or purchase its outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices as it may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, its liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material and to the extent equity is used, dilutive. \nOn December 22, 2022, the Company entered into the Forward Purchase Agreement with Antara pursuant to which the Company agreed to (i) sell to Antara \n10,659,511\n AMC Preferred Equity Units for an aggregate purchase price of $\n75.1\n million and (ii) simultaneously purchase from Antara $\n100.0\n million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s \n10\n%/\n12\n% Cash/PIK Toggle Second Lien Notes due 2026 in exchange for \n9,102,619\n AMC Preferred Equity Units. On February 7, 2023, the Company issued \n19,762,130\n AMC Preferred Equity Units to Antara in exchange for $\n75.1\n million in cash and $\n100.0\n million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s \n10\n%/\n12\n% Cash/PIK Toggle Second Lien Notes due 2026. The Company recorded $\n193.7\n million to stockholders\u2019 deficit as a result of the transaction. The Company paid $\n1.4\n million of accrued interest in cash upon exchange of the notes.

The Company paid $\n12.6\n million of other third-party issuance costs during \n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthe year ended December 31, 2023. See Note 9\u2014Stockholders\u2019 Deficit for further information regarding the at-the-market offerings.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold \n20.8\n million AMC Preferred Equity Units. The Company generated approximately $\n228.8\n million in gross proceeds from sales under one \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering program, paid fees to the sales agents and incurred third-party issuance costs of approximately $\n5.7\n million and $\n5.5\n million, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold \n24.2\n million shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and \n24.2\n million AMC Preferred Equity Units. The Company generated $\n1,611.8\n million in aggregate gross proceeds from sales under various \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering programs, paid fees to the sales agents of approximately $\n40.3\n million and paid other fees of $\n0.8\n million.\nTemporarily Suspended or Limited Operations.\n  For approximately the first six months of the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had suspended or limited operations in our International markets segment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, 2021, substantially all of our International markets theatres had resumed operations.\nUse of Estimates.\n  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation.\n  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Holdings and all subsidiaries, as discussed above. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated in the Company\u2019s consolidated subsidiaries; consequently, a portion of its stockholders\u2019 deficit, net earnings (loss) and total comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company manages its business under \ntwo\n reportable segments for its theatrical exhibition operations: U.S. markets and International markets.\nNoncontrolling Interests and Baltic Theatre Sale.\n Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements; consequently, a portion of its stockholders\u2019 deficit, net earnings (loss) and total comprehensive income (loss) for the periods presented are attributable to noncontrolling interests. On August 28, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its equity interest in Forum Cinemas OU, which consists of \nnine\n theatres located in the Baltic region (Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia) and that were included in the Company\u2019s International markets reportable segment, for total consideration of approximately \u20ac\n77.25\n million, including cash of approximately \u20ac\n64.35\n million or $\n76.6\n million prior to any transaction costs. This transaction was undertaken by the Company to further increase its liquidity and strengthen its balance sheet. The completion of the sale took place in several steps, as noted below, and was contingent upon clearance from each regulatory competition council in each country. \nThe Company received $\n37.5\n million (\u20ac\n31.53\n million) cash consideration upon entering into the sale agreement on August 28, 2020 and paid $\n0.5\n million in transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company transferred an equity interest of \n49\n% in Forum Cinemas OU to the purchaser and recorded an initial noncontrolling interest of $\n34.9\n million in total equity (deficit). Transaction costs of $\n1.4\n million and net gain of $\n1.2\n million related to the sale of \n49\n% equity interest of Lithuania and Estonia and the \n100\n% disposal of Latvia were recorded in additional paid-in capital during the year ended December 31, 2020 and were recorded in earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021 when the remaining \n51\n% interests in Lithuania and Estonia were disposed. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received cash consideration of $\n6.2\n million (\u20ac\n5.3\n million), net of cash of $\n0.2\n million for the remaining \n51\n% equity interest in Latvia. At December 31, 2020, the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities included as part of the disposal group that were previously included in the International markets reportable segment were; goodwill of $\n41.8\n million, property, net, of $\n13.0\n million, operating lease right-of-use assets, net of $\n15.7\n million, and current and long-term operating lease liabilities of $\n2.4\n million and $\n13.7\n million, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s noncontrolling interest of \n49\n% in Lithuania and Estonia was $\n26.9\n million. \n\u200b\n79\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received cash consideration of $\n34.2\n million (\u20ac\n29.4\n million), net of cash disposed of $\n0.4\n million and transaction costs of $\n1.3\n million, for the remaining \n51\n% equity interest in Estonia, \n51\n% equity interest in Lithuania and eliminated the Company\u2019s noncontrolling interest in Forum Cinemas OU. The Company recorded the net gain from the sale of its equity interest in Forum Cinemas OU of $\n5.5\n million (net of transaction costs of $\n2.6\n million) in \ninvestment expense (income)\n, during the year ended December 31, 2021. \nRevenues.\n \nThe Company recognizes revenue, net of sales tax, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. Admissions and food and beverage revenues are recorded at a point in time when a film is exhibited to a customer and when a customer takes possession of food and beverage offerings. The Company defers \n100\n% of the revenue associated with the sales of gift cards and exchange tickets until such time as the items are redeemed or estimated income from non-redemption is recorded. \nThe Company recognizes income from non-redeemed or partially redeemed gift cards in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer (\u201cproportional method\u201d) where it applies an estimated non-redemption rate for its gift card sales channels, which range from \n13\n% to \n19\n% of the current month sales of gift cards, and the Company recognizes in other theatre revenues the total amount of expected income for non-redemption for that current month\u2019s sales as income over the next \n24 months\n in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions. The Company has determined its non-redeemed rates and redemption patterns using more than 10 years of accumulated data. The Company also recognizes income from non-redeemed or partially redeemed exchange tickets using the proportional method. In the International markets, certain exchange tickets are subject to expiration dates, which triggers recognition of non-redemption in other revenues.\nThe Company recognizes ticket fee revenues based on a gross transaction price. The Company is a principal (as opposed to agent) in the arrangement with third-party internet ticketing companies in regard to the sale of online tickets because the Company controls the online tickets before they are transferred to the customer. The online ticket fee revenues and the third-party commission or service fees are recorded in the line items other theatre revenues and operating expense, respectively, in the consolidated statements of operations. \nFilm Exhibition Costs.\n  Film exhibition costs are accrued based on the applicable box office receipts and estimates of the final settlement to the film licensors. Film exhibition costs include certain advertising costs. As of December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, the Company recorded film payables of \n$\n130.9\n\u00a0million and $\n123.8\n\u00a0million, respectively, which are included in accounts payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nFood and Beverage Costs.\n  The Company records rebate payments from vendors as a reduction of food and beverage costs when earned.\nExhibitor Services Agreement.\n \nThe Company recognizes advertising revenues, which are included in other theatre revenues in the consolidated statements of operations, when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to the customers. The advertising contracts with customers generally consist of a series of distinct periods of service, satisfied over time, to provide rights to advertising services. The Company\u2019s Exhibitor Services Agreement (\u201cESA\u201d) with National CineMedia, LLC (\u201cNCM\u201d) includes a significant financing component due to the significant length of time between receiving the non-cash consideration and fulfilling the performance obligation. The Company receives the non-cash consideration in the form of common membership units from NCM, in exchange for rights to exclusive access to the Company\u2019s theatre screens and attendees through February\u00a02037. Upon recognition, the Company records an increase to advertising revenues with a similar offsetting increase in non-cash interest expense, which is recorded to non-cash NCM exhibitor service agreement in the consolidated statements of operations. Pursuant to the calculation requirements for the time value of money, the amortization method reflects the front-end loading of the significant financing component where more interest expense is recognized earlier during the term of the agreement than the back-end recognition of the deferred revenue amortization where more revenue is recognized later in the term of the agreement. See Note 2\n\u2014\nRevenue Recognition and Note\u00a06\n\u2014\nInvestments for further information regarding the common unit adjustment (\u201cCUA\u201d) and the fair value measurement of the non-cash consideration.\n\u200b\n80\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCustomer Loyalty Programs.\n  AMC Stubs\n\u00ae\n (\u201cStubs\u201d) is a customer loyalty program in the U.S. markets which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features both a paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere\nTM\n (\u201cPremiere\u201d) for a flat annual membership fee and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs\n\u00ae\n Insider\nTM\n (\u201cInsider\u201d). Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC Theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations.\nThe portion of the admissions and food and beverage revenues attributed to the rewards is deferred as a reduction of admissions and food and beverage revenues and is allocated between admissions and food and beverage revenues based on expected member redemptions. Upon redemption, deferred rewards are recognized as revenues along with associated cost of goods. The Company estimates point breakage in assigning value to the points at the time of sale based on historical trends. The program\u2019s annual membership fee is allocated to the material rights for discounted or free products and services and is initially deferred, net of estimated refunds, and recognized as the rights are redeemed based on estimated utilization, over the one-year membership period in admissions, food and beverage, and other revenues. A portion of the revenues related to a material right are deferred as a virtual rewards performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price method and are recognized as the rights are redeemed or expire.\nAMC Stubs\n\u00ae\n A-List (\u201cA-List\u201d) is the Company\u2019s monthly subscription-based tier of the Stubs\n \nloyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to movies from $\n19.95\n and $\n24.95\n per month depending upon geographic market. Revenue is recognized ratably over the enrollment period. \nAdvertising Costs.\n  The Company expenses advertising costs as incurred and does not have any direct-response advertising recorded as assets. Advertising costs were \n$\n43.6\n million, $\n28.0\n million, and $\n28.4\n million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2023, December\u00a031, 2022, and December\u00a031, 2021, respectively, and are recorded in operating expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nCash and Cash Equivalents.\n  All investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. At December 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents for the U.S. markets and International markets were \n$\n752.3\n million and $\n132.0\n million, respectively, and at December 31, 2022, cash and cash equivalents were $\n508.0\n million and $\n123.5\n million, respectively.\nRestricted Cash.\n  Restricted cash is cash held in the Company's bank accounts in International markets as a guarantee for certain landlords. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to the total of the amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n(In millions)\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031, 2023\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031, 2022\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031, 2021\nCash and cash equivalents\n\u200b\n$\n \n884.3\n\u200b\n$\n \n631.5\n\u200b\n$\n \n1,592.5\nRestricted cash\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n27.1\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n22.9\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n27.8\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash in the statement of cash flows\n\u200b\n$\n \n911.4\n\u200b\n$\n \n654.4\n\u200b\n$\n \n1,620.3\n\u200b\nIntangible Assets.\n Intangible assets are comprised of management contracts, a trademark, and trade names. Amortizable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets. The Company evaluates definite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. Trademark and trade names are considered either definite or indefinite-lived intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently as specific events or circumstances dictate.\nThe Company first assesses the qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. There were \nno\n intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the years ended December\u00a031, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021.\n\u200b\n81\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInvestments.\n  The Company accounts for its investments in non-consolidated entities using either the cost or equity methods of accounting as appropriate, and has recorded the investments within other long-term assets in its consolidated balance sheets. Equity earnings and losses are recorded when the Company\u2019s ownership interest provides the Company with significant influence. The Company follows the guidance in ASC\u00a0323-30-35-3, investment in a limited liability company, which prescribes the use of the equity method for investments where the Company has significant influence. The Company classifies gains and losses on sales of investments or impairments accounted for using the cost method in investment expense (income). Gains and losses on cash sales are recorded using the weighted average cost of all interests in the investments. Gains and losses related to non-cash negative common unit adjustments are recorded using the weighted average cost of those units in NCM. See Note\u00a06\n\u2014\nInvestments for further discussion of the Company\u2019s investments in NCM. As of December\u00a031, 2023, the Company holds equity method investments comprised of a \n18.3\n% interest in SV Holdco LLC (\u201cSV Holdco\u201d), a joint venture that markets and sells cinema advertising and promotions through Screenvision; a \n50.0\n% interest in Digital Cinema Media Ltd. (\u201cDCM\u201d), a joint venture that provides advertising services in International markets; a \n32.0\n% interest in AC JV, LLC (\u201cAC JV\u201d), a joint venture that owns Fathom Events offering alternative content for motion picture screens; a \n14.6\n% interest in Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, LLC (\u201cDCDC\u201d), a satellite distribution network for feature films and other digital cinema content; a \n50\n% ownership interest in \nfour\n U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately \n50\n% ownership interest in \n61\n theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. \nGoodwill.\n  The Company\u2019s recorded goodwill was \n$\n2,358.7\n\u00a0million and $\n2,342.0\n\u00a0million as of December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, respectively. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets related to the acquisition of Holdings on August\u00a030, 2012 and subsequent theatre business acquisitions. The Company evaluates goodwill at its \ntwo\n reporting units (Domestic Theatres and International Theatres). Also, the Company evaluates goodwill and its indefinite-lived trademark and trade names for impairment annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and any time an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value for a reporting unit below its carrying amount. \nIn accordance with ASC 350-20-35-30, goodwill of a reporting unit shall be tested for impairment between annual tests by assessing the qualitative factors to determine if an event occurs or changes in circumstances that would warrant an interim ASC 350 impairment analysis. If an impairment analysis is needed, the Company performs a quantitative impairment test for goodwill, which involves estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing that value to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as goodwill impairment charge, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nQualitative impairment tests\n. The Company performed a qualitative impairment test to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than their respective carrying amount as of its annual assessment date, October 1st. The Company concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of either of the Company\u2019s two reporting units had been reduced below their respective carrying amounts at the annual assessment date for 2022 or 2023. The Company concluded that there were no triggering events that had occurred between the annual assessment date and December 31, 2023.\nOther Long-term Assets.\n  Other long-term assets are comprised principally of investments in partnerships and joint ventures and capitalized computer software, which is amortized over the estimated useful life of the software. See Note\u00a07\n\u2014\nSupplemental Balance Sheet Information. \nAccounts Payable.\n  Under the Company\u2019s cash management system, checks issued but not presented to banks frequently result in book overdraft balances for accounting purposes and are classified within accounts payable in the balance sheet. The change in book overdrafts is reported as a component of operating cash flows for accounts payable as they do not represent bank overdrafts. The amount of these checks included in accounts payable as of December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022 was \n$\n3.0\n\u00a0million and $\n2.2\n\u00a0million, respectively.\nLeases.\n \nThe Company leases theatres and equipment under operating and finance leases. Many of the leases contain options to extend the leases for additional periods. The Company typically does not believe that the exercise of the renewal options is reasonably assured at the inception of the lease agreements and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally, the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index and other indexes not to exceed certain specified amounts and variable rentals based on a percentage of revenues. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for \n82\n\n\nTable of Contents\nrenovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities were recorded at commencement date based on the present value of minimum lease payments over the remaining lease term. The minimum lease payments include base rent and other fixed payments, including fixed maintenance costs. The present value of the lease payments is calculated using the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, which was determined using a portfolio approach based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term. Operating lease expense is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nThe Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components and also elected the short-term practical expedient for all leases that qualify. As a result, the Company will not recognize right-of-use assets or liabilities for short-term leases that qualify for the short-term practical expedient, but instead will recognize the lease payments as lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company\u2019s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees. Short-term leases and sublease arrangements are immaterial. Equipment leases primarily consist of food and beverage and digital equipment. \nImpairment of Long-lived Assets.\n  The Company reviews long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangibles and theatre assets (including operating lease right-of-use assets) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be fully recoverable. The Company identifies impairments related to internal use software when management determines that the remaining carrying value of the software will not be realized through future use. The Company evaluates events or circumstances, including competition in the markets where it operates, that would indicate the carrying value of the asset groups may not be fully recoverable. If an event or circumstance is identified indicating carrying value may not be recoverable, the sum of future undiscounted cash flows is compared to the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows, the asset group may be impaired. If the asset group is determined to be impaired, the carrying value of the asset group is reduced to fair value as estimated by a discounted cash flow model, with the difference recorded as an impairment charge. Asset groups are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which management believes is the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The Company evaluates theatres using historical and projected data of theatre level cash flow as its primary indicator of potential impairment and considers the seasonality of its business when making these evaluations. The fair value of assets is determined as either the expected selling price less selling costs (where appropriate) or the present value of the estimated future cash flows, adjusted as necessary for market participant factors. \nThere is considerable management judgment necessary to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair values of the Company\u2019s theatres and other long-lived assets, and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates, which fall under Level\u00a03 within the fair value measurement hierarchy, see Note\u00a012\n\u2014\nFair Value Measurements. \nThe following table summarizes the Company\u2019s impairments for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031, \n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031, \n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031, \n(In millions)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n2023\n\u00a0\n2022\n\u200b\n2021\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n\u200b\n$\n \n106.9\n\u200b\n$\n \n133.1\n\u200b\n$\n \n77.2\nImpairment of other assets recorded in investment expense (income)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n1.0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \u2014\nTotal impairment loss\n\u200b\n$\n \n107.9\n\u200b\n$\n \n133.1\n\u200b\n$\n \n77.2\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded non-cash impairment of long-lived assets of $\n49.2\n million on \n68\n theatres in the U.S. markets with \n738\n screens (in Alabama, Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, West Virginia) and $\n57.7\n million on \n57\n theatres in the International markets with \n488\n screens (in Germany, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and UK), which were related to property, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, net.

Assets and liabilities are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange. The resultant translation adjustments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment, a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in net earnings (loss), except those intercompany transactions of a long-term investment nature. If the Company substantially liquidates its investment in a foreign entity, any gain or loss on currency translation or transaction balance recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded as part of a gain or loss on disposition.\nEmployee Benefit Plans.\n  The Company sponsors frozen non-contributory qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and frozen defined benefit pension plans in the U.K. and Sweden. The Company also sponsored a postretirement deferred compensation plan, which was liquidated during 2022, and also various defined contribution plans.\nThe following table sets forth the plans\u2019 benefit obligations and plan assets included in the consolidated balance sheets: \n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nU.S. Pension Benefits\n\u200b\nInternational Pension Benefits \n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n(In millions)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2022\nAggregated projected benefit obligation at end of period (1)\n\u200b\n$\n (\n79.3\n)\n\u200b\n$\n (\n79.7\n)\n\u200b\n$\n (\n71.9\n)\n\u200b\n$\n (\n66.8\n)\nAggregated fair value of plan assets at end of period\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \n58.3\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \n59.2\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \n76.7\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \n73.1\nNet (liability) asset - funded status\n\u200b\n$\n (\n21.0\n)\n\u200b\n$\n (\n20.5\n)\n\u200b\n$\n \n4.8\n\u200b\n$\n \n6.3\n(1)\nAt December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, U.S. aggregated accumulated benefit obligations were \n$\n79.3\n million and \n$\n79.7\n million, respectively, and International aggregated accumulated benefit obligations were \n$\n71.9\n million and \n$\n66.8\n million, respectively.\nThe Company does not expect to make a material contribution to the U.S. pension plans during the year ended December 31, 2024.

The Company uses a diversified allocation of equity, debt, commodity and real estate exposures that are customized to the plan\u2019s cash flow benefit needs. A weighted average targeted allocation percentage is assigned to each asset class as follows: equity securities of \n37\n%, debt securities of \n59\n%, and private real estate of \n4\n%. The International pension benefit plans do not have an established asset target allocation.\nInvestments in the pension plan assets are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2023, for the U.S. investment portfolio, \n92\n% were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient and \n8\n% of the investment included pooled separate accounts valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy). As of December 31, 2023, for the International investment portfolio, \n4\n% consisting of cash and equivalents was valued using quoted market prices from actively traded markets (Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy), \n28\n% included mutual funds and collective trust funds valued using market prices for the underlying instruments that were observable in the market or could be derived by observable market data from independent external valuation information (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy) and \n68\n% were valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient.\nDuring 2023, there was a ruling in the United Kingdom related to the validity of certain amendments to benefits in contracted-out salary-related defined benefit pension plans. The ruling is subject to an ongoing appeal. The ruling may potentially be applicable to certain defined benefit pension plans the Company has in the United Kingdom. While the Company does not believe the impact of this ruling will have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation, it will continue to monitor the appeals process. As of December 31, 2023, no specific adjustments for this matter have been included in estimating the projected benefit obligation and related net periodic benefit cost of the applicable plans.\n85\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company sponsors various defined contribution plans which include company match features in the U.S. and Internationally. The expense related to defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, was $\n9.8\n million, $\n9.0\n million, and $\n8.4\n million, respectively.\nIncome and Operating Taxes.\n  The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC\u00a0740-10. Under ASC\u00a0740-10, deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded by the asset and liability method. This method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and recognizes changes in income tax laws in the period of enactment. \nHoldings and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and combined income tax returns in certain state jurisdictions. Foreign subsidiaries file income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. Income taxes are determined based on separate Company computations of income or loss. Tax sharing arrangements are in place and utilized when tax benefits from affiliates in the consolidated group are used to offset what would otherwise be taxable income generated by Holdings or another affiliate.\nCasualty Insurance.\n  The Company is self-insured for general liability up to \n$\n1.0\n\u00a0million per occurrence and carries a $\n0.5\n\u00a0million deductible limit per occurrence for workers\u2019 compensation claims. The Company utilizes actuarial projections of its ultimate losses to calculate its reserves and expense. The actuarial method includes an allowance for adverse developments on known claims and an allowance for claims which have been incurred but which have not yet been reported. As of December\u00a031, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, the Company recorded casualty insurance reserves of $\n22.8\n million and $\n30.7\n\u00a0million, respectively. The Company recorded expenses related to general liability and workers\u2019 compensation claims of $\n53.1\n\u00a0million, $\n49.8\n\u00a0million, and $\n37.1\n\u00a0million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2023, December\u00a031, 2022, and December\u00a031, 2021, respectively. Casualty insurance expense is recorded in operating expense.\nGovernment Assistance.\n  The Company recognizes government assistance when the conditions of the grant have been met and there is reasonable assurance that the assistance will be received. Grants relating to specific costs are treated as a reduction of that cost in the consolidated statement of operations. General grants are recorded within other expense (income). Grants related to the construction of long-lived assets are treated as reductions to the cost of the associated assets. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized government assistance in \nother income\n of $\n4.8\n million, primarily related to grants in the International markets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized government assistance in other income of $\n25.8\n million, primarily related to grants in the International markets. The general requirements of the grants were that the grantees must have lost income due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company concluded all grant criteria had been met and therefore have recognized the entire award.\nAdditionally, the Company recognized $\n3.2\n million and $\n1.9\n million of government assistance as reduction to property, net during the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.

The Company elected to apply the optional expedients under ASC 848 to modifications of contracts that previously referenced LIBOR. The optional expedients eliminate the need to remeasure the contracts or reassess any accounting determinations. See Note 8\u2014Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations for further discussion on the election of the optional expedients allowed under ASC 848.\nAccounting Pronouncements Issued Not Yet Adopted\n \nSegment Reporting\n. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASC 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (\u201cASU 2023-07\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 require annual and interim disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2024, and every interim period thereafter.\nIncome Tax Disclosures\n. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASC 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (\u201cASU 2023-09\u201d). The amendments in ASU 2023-09 require entities to disclose on an annual basis (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. The amendments would also require that entities disclose various information about income taxes paid and (1) income (or loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (or benefit) disaggregated between domestic and (2) foreign and income tax expense (or benefit) from continuing operations disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2025.\n\u200b\n87\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 2\u2014REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\u200b\nDisaggregation of Revenue. \nRevenue is

The deferred revenues are being amortized to other theatre revenues over the remainder of the \n30\n-year term of the ESA ending in February\u00a02037.\n \n\u200b\nNCM Bankruptcy. \nOn April 11, 2023, NCM filed a petition under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the Southern District of Texas. NCM is the in-theatre advertising provider for the majority of the Company\u2019s theatres in the United States. Under the Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, which became effective on August 7, 2023 (the \u201cPlan\u201d), NCM has assumed its agreements with the Company. As part of the Plan, on August 7, 2023, NCM issued \n16,581,829\n common units (\u201cNCM Common Units\u201d) that were owed to the Company as part of the annual common unit adjustment. But under the terms of the Plan and restructuring of the equity of NCM thereunder, the NCM Common Units were immediately cancelled upon the efficacy of the Plan. The Company has filed appeals with the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, objecting to, among other things, certain terms of the Plan, including modification of the terms of the exhibitor services agreement with other parties that were not granted to the Company and appeal of the court\u2019s order to approve cancellation of the NCM Common Unit issuance. The Company does not expect the NCM bankruptcy to have a material impact on the Company.\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations.\n \nThe following table includes the amount of NCM ESA, included in exhibitor services agreement in the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets, that is expected to be recognized as revenues in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of December\u00a031, 2023:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n(In millions)\n\u200b\nExhibitor Services Agreement\nYear ended 2024\n\u200b\n$\n \n22.7\nYear ended 2025\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n24.4\nYear ended 2026\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n26.2\nYear ended 2027\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n28.2\nYear ended 2028\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n30.4\nYears ended 2029 through February 2037\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n354.7\nTotal\n\u200b\n$      \n \n486.6\n\u200b\nGift Cards and Exchange Tickets.\n The total amount of non-redeemed gift cards and exchange tickets included in deferred revenues and income as of December\u00a031, 2023 was $\n326.3\n\u00a0million. This will be recognized as revenues as the gift cards and exchange tickets are redeemed or as the non-redeemed gift card and exchange ticket revenues are recognized in proportion to the pattern of actual redemptions, which is estimated to occur over the next \n24 months\n. \nLoyalty Programs.\n As of December\u00a031, 2023, the amount of deferred revenues allocated to the loyalty programs included in deferred revenues and income was $\n73.6\n\u00a0million. The earned points will be recognized as revenue as the points are redeemed, which is estimated to occur over the next \n24 months\n. The Premiere\n \nannual membership fee is recognized ratably over the one-year membership period.\nThe Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less.\n90\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nNOTE 3\u2014LEASES\nThe Company leases theatres and equipment under operating and finance leases. The Company typically does not believe that exercise of the renewal options is reasonably certain at the lease commencement and, therefore, considers the initial base term as the lease term. Lease terms vary but generally the leases provide for fixed and escalating rentals, contingent escalating rentals based on the Consumer Price Index and other indexes not to exceed certain specified amounts and variable rentals based on a percentage of revenues. The Company often receives contributions from landlords for renovations at existing locations. The Company records the amounts received from landlords as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and amortizes the balance as a reduction to rent expense over the base term of the lease agreement. Equipment leases primarily consist of sight and sound and food and beverage equipment.\nThe Company received rent concessions from lessors that aided in mitigating the economic effects of COVID-19 during the pandemic. These concessions primarily consisted of rent abatements and the deferral of rent payments. As a result, deferred lease amounts were approximately $\n56.3\n million as of December 31, 2023. In instances where there were no substantive changes to the lease terms, i.e., modifications that resulted in total payments of the modified lease being substantially the same or less than the total payments of the existing lease, the Company elected the relief as provided by the FASB staff related to the accounting for certain lease concessions. The Company elected not to account for these concessions as a lease modification, and therefore the Company has remeasured the related lease liability and right-of-use asset but did not reassess the lease classification or change the discount rate to the current rate in effect upon the remeasurement. The deferred payment amounts have been recorded in the Company\u2019s lease liabilities to reflect the change in the timing of payments. Those leases that did not meet the criteria for treatment under the FASB relief were evaluated as lease modifications. The deferred payment amounts for contractual rent amounts due and not paid are included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheets and in change in accounts payable in the consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, the Company included deferred lease payments in operating lease right-of-use assets as a result of lease remeasurements. \nA summary of deferred payment amounts related to rent

and certain other investments accounted for under the equity method generally include all entities in which the Company or its subsidiaries have significant influence, but not more than \n50\n% voting control, and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets in other long-term assets. On December 30, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its \n10.0\n% investment in Saudi Cinema Company, LLC for SAR \n112.5\n million ($\n30.0\n million), and on January 24, 2023, the Saudi Ministry of Commerce recorded the sale of equity and the Company received the proceeds on January 25, 2023. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of $\n15.5\n million in investment income during the year ended December 31, 2023. Investments in non-consolidated affiliates as of December\u00a031, 2023, include interests in DCDC of \n14.6\n%, AC JV, owner of Fathom Events, of \n32.0\n%, SV Holdco, owner of Screenvision, of \n18.4\n%, and DCM of \n50.0\n%. The Company also has partnership interests in \nfour\n U.S. motion picture theatres and approximately \n50.0\n% interest in \n61\n theatres in Europe. Indebtedness held by equity method investees is non-recourse to the Company. \nInvestment in Hycroft \nOn March 14, 2022, the Company purchased \n2.3\n million units of Hycroft for $\n27.9\n million, with each unit consisting of \none\n common share of Hycroft and \none\n common share purchase warrant. The units were priced at $\n11.93\n per unit. Each warrant is exercisable for \none\n common share of Hycroft at a price of $\n10.68\n per share over a \n5-year\n term through March 2027. The preceding amounts have been adjusted for the \none-for-ten\n reverse stock split Hycroft effectuated on November 15, 2023.\nHycroft filed a resale registration statement to register the common shares and warrant shares for the sale under Securities Act on April 14, 2022 which became effective on June 2, 2022. The Company accounts for the common shares of Hycroft under the equity method and we have elected the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825-10. The Company account for the warrants as derivatives in accordance with ASC 815. Accordingly, the fair value of the investments in Hycroft are remeasured at each subsequent reporting period and unrealized gains and losses are reported in investment income. The Company believes the fair value option to be the most appropriate election for this equity method investment as the Company is not entering the mining business. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Company recorded unrealized losses related to the investment in Hycroft of $\n12.6\n million and $\n6.3\n million, respectively, in investment expense (income), respectively. \nNCM Transactions\nPursuant to the Company\u2019s Common Unit Adjustment Agreement, from time to time common units of NCM held by the Founding Members will be adjusted up or down through a formula, primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre attendance generated by each Founding Member. The CUA is computed annually, except that an earlier CUA will occur for a Founding Member if its acquisition or disposition of theatres, in a single transaction or cumulatively since the most recent CUA, will cause a change of \n2\n% or more in the total annual attendance of all of the Founding Members. In the event that a CUA is determined to be a negative number, the Founding Member shall cause, at its election, either (a)\u00a0the transfer and surrender to NCM of a number of common units equal to all or part of such Founding Member\u2019s CUA or (b)\u00a0pay to NCM an amount equal to such Founding Member\u2019s CUA calculated in accordance with the CUA Agreement.\nIn March 2021, the NCM CUA resulted in a negative adjustment of \n3,012,738\n common units for the Company, and therefore, the Company paid NCM cash of $\n9.2\n million and recorded the amount as a reduction to deferred revenues for the ESA. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold its remaining approximately \n1.4\n million NCM shares and received net proceeds of $\n5.7\n million, which were recorded in investment expense (income). In March 2022, the NCM CUA resulted in a positive adjustment of \n5,954,646\n common units for the Company. The Company received the units and recorded the common units as an addition to deferred revenues for the ESA at a fair value of $\n15.0\n million, based upon a price per share of NCM of $\n2.52\n on March 30, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company sold its shares of NCM for $\n1.5\n million and recorded a realized loss in investment expense of $\n13.5\n million. See Note 1\n\u2014\nThe Company and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2\n\u2014\nRevenue Recognition for further information regarding CUA and ESA.\n96\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDCIP Transactions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company received cash distribution of $\n12.2\n million from DCIP, which the Company recorded as a reduction to its investment in DCIP. The distribution reduced the Company\u2019s recorded investment below $\n0\n and therefore the Company recorded equity in earnings of $\n4.0\n million to increase its investment to $\n0\n as the Company has not guaranteed any of the liabilities of DCIP. During the year ended December 31, 2022, DCIP ceased operations and the Company received a liquidation distribution of $\n3.4\n million which the Company recorded as equity in earnings. \nAC JV Transactions\nOn December\u00a026, 2013, the Company amended and restated its existing ESA with NCM in connection with the spin-off by NCM of its Fathom Events business to AC JV, a newly-formed company owned \n32\n% by each of the Founding Members and \n4\n% by NCM. AC JV distributes alternative content to theatre exhibitors. As of December 31, 2019, Cinemark and Regal also amended and restated their respective ESAs with NCM in connection with the spin-off. The ESAs were modified to remove those provisions addressing the rights and obligations related to digital programing services of the Fathom Events business. Those provisions are now contained in the Amended and Restated Digital Programming Exhibitor Services Agreements (the \u201cDigital ESAs\u201d) that were entered into on December\u00a026, 2013 by NCM and each of the Founding Members. These Digital ESAs were then assigned by NCM to AC JV as part of the Fathom spin-off. \nSummary Financial Information\nInvestments in non-consolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method as of December\u00a031, 2023, include interests in Hycroft, SV Holdco, DCM, AC JV, DCDC, \n61\n theatres in Europe, \nfour\n U.S. motion picture theatres, and other immaterial investments.\nCondensed

certain Third Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of May\u00a09, 2017, that certain Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of June\u00a013, 2017, that certain Fifth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of August\u00a014, 2018, that certain Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of April 22, 2019, that certain Seventh Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of April 23, 2020, that certain Eighth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of July 31, 2020, that certain Ninth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of March 8, 2021, that certain Tenth Amendment to Credit Agreement, also dated as of March 8, 2021, that certain Eleventh Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of December 20, 2021 (the \u201cEleventh Amendment\u201d), that certain Twelfth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of January 25, 2023 (the \u201cTwelfth Amendment\u201d), and that certain Thirteenth Amendment to Credit Agreement, dated as of June 23, 2023 (the \u201cThirteenth Amendment\u201d) the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), with the issuing banks and lenders from time to time party thereto and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent (as successor to Citicorp North America, Inc., the\u00a0\u201cAdministrative Agent\u201d), pursuant to which the lenders have agreed to provide the Senior Secured Term Loans (as defined below) and the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below). The Senior Secured Credit Facilities (as defined below) are provided by a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions.\nOn June 23, 2023, the Company and Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent, entered into the Thirteenth Amendment, pursuant to which LIBOR, the benchmark rate upon which certain loans, commitments and/or other extensions of credit under the Credit Agreement incur interest, fees or other amounts, was replaced with Term SOFR, a benchmark rate reported by the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited that is based on the secured overnight financing rate. Term SOFR under the Credit Agreement is subject to a credit spread adjustment equal to \n0.11448\n% per annum, \n0.26161\n% per annum, and \n0.42826\n% per annum for interest periods of one-month, three-months, or six-months or longer, respectively. The Thirteenth Amendment became effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on June 30, 2023.\nThe Company elected to apply the optional expedients allowed under ASC 848 regarding the discontinuation of LIBOR and reference rate reform. Pursuant to ASC 848, the Thirteenth Amendment was determined to be an insubstantial modification.\nOn March 8, 2021, the Company entered into the Ninth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the \u201cNinth Amendment\u201d), with the requisite revolving lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent, pursuant to which the requisite revolving lenders party thereto agreed to extend the suspension period for the financial covenant applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement (the \u201cCovenant Suspension Period\u201d) from a period ending March 31, 2021, to a period ending on March 31, 2022, which was extended by the Eleventh Amendment to a period ending on March 31, 2023, which was further extended by the Twelfth Amendment to a period ending on March 31, 2024 (the Covenant Suspension Period as so extended, the \u201cExtended Covenant Suspension Period\u201d). During the Extended Covenant Suspension Period, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its restricted subsidiaries to, (i) make certain restricted payments, (ii) subject to certain exceptions, incur any indebtedness for  borrowed money that is pari passu or senior in right of payment or security with the Revolving Loans (as defined in the Credit Agreement) or (iii) make any investment in or otherwise dispose of any assets to any subsidiary of the Company that is not a Loan Party (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to facilitate a new financing incurred by a subsidiary of the Company. In addition, \n101\n\n\nTable of Contents\nas an ongoing condition to the suspension of the financial covenant, the Company also agreed to (i) a minimum liquidity test of \n$\n100\n million, (ii) an anti-cash hoarding test at any time Revolving Loans are outstanding and (iii) additional reporting obligations. In addition, on March 8, 2021 the Company entered into the Tenth Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the \u201cTenth Amendment\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed not to consent to certain modifications to the Credit Agreement described in the Tenth Amendment without the consent of the majority of the revolving lenders party to the Tenth Amendment. The current maturity date of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is April 22, 2024 and we currently do not expect to extend such maturity or replace the Senior Secured Revolving Facility upon such maturity.\nOn July 31, 2020, the Company entered into the Eighth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the \u201cEighth Amendment\u201d) with Citicorp North America, Inc., as the administrative agent, pursuant to which certain restrictive provisions, including modifications to the covenants limiting indebtedness, liens, investments, asset sales and restricted payments, were added to the Credit Agreement to ensure that the terms and conditions of the First Lien Notes due 2026, the Convertible Notes due 2026 and the Second Lien Notes due 2026 (subject to certain exceptions) are not materially more favorable (when taken as a whole) to the noteholders than the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement (when taken as a whole) are to the lenders thereunder. \nOn April 23, 2020, the Company entered into the Seventh Amendment to Credit Agreement (the \u201cSeventh Amendment\u201d) with the requisite revolving lenders party thereto and Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent, pursuant to which the requisite revolving lenders party thereto agreed to suspend the financial covenant applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility for the period from and after the effective date of the Seventh Amendment to and including the earlier of (a) March 31, 2021 and (b) the day immediately preceding the last day of the Test Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement) during which the Company has delivered a Financial Covenant Election (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to the Administrative Agent (such period, the \u201cInitial Covenant Suspension Period\u201d). During the Initial Covenant Suspension Period, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its restricted subsidiaries to, make certain restricted payments, and such conditions were further amended by the Ninth Amendment. As an ongoing condition to the suspension of the financial covenant, the Company agreed to a minimum Liquidity (as defined in the Seventh Amendment) test, which was amended by the Ninth Amendment. In addition, the Seventh Amendment provides for certain changes to the covenants limiting indebtedness, liens and restricted payments that were intended to match corresponding restrictions under the \n10.5\n% First Lien Notes due 2025 (the \u201cFirst Lien Notes due 2025\u201d) and to ensure that the terms and conditions of the First Lien Notes due 2025 (subject to certain exceptions) are not materially more favorable (when taken as a whole) to the noteholders than the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement (when taken as a whole) are to the lenders thereunder. Pursuant to the terms of the Seventh Amendment, these more restrictive terms will be operative until the repayment, satisfaction, defeasance or other discharge of the obligations under the First Lien Notes due 2025 or an effective amendment of, other consent or waiver with respect to, or covenant defeasance pursuant to the Indenture as result of which the covenants limiting indebtedness, liens and restricted payments thereunder are of no further force or effect. Certain provisions of the Seventh Amendment are amended by the Ninth Amendment.\nOn April\u00a022, 2019, the Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the \u201cSixth Amendment\u201d) with each lender party thereto and Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent. Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, the lenders agreed to provide senior secured financing of $\n2,225.0\n million in aggregate, consisting of (i)\u00a0$\n2,000.0\n million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured tranche B loans maturing April 22, 2026 (the\u00a0\u201cSenior Secured Term Loans\u201d) and (ii)\u00a0a $\n225.0\n million senior secured revolving credit facility (which is also available for letters of credit and for swingline borrowings on same-day notice) maturing April\u00a022, 2024 (the\u00a0\u201cSenior Secured Revolving Credit Facility\u201d and, together with the Senior Secured Term Loan Loans, the\u00a0\u201cSenior Secured Credit Facilities\u201d).\nAll obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by, subject to certain exceptions, each of the Company\u2019s current and future wholly-owned material U.S. restricted subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to customary exceptions, including:\n\u25cf\na pledge of \n100\n%\n of the equity interests directly held by the Company and each guarantor in any wholly-owned material subsidiary of the Company or any guarantor (which pledge, in the case of any non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. subsidiary, will not include more than \n65\n%\n of the voting stock of such non-U.S. subsidiary), subject to certain exceptions; and\n102\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u25cf\na security interest in substantially all other tangible and intangible assets of the Company and each guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. \nThe Credit Agreement will require the Company to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:\n\u25cf\n50\n%\n (which percentage will be reduced to \n0\n%\n if the Company attains a certain secured net leverage ratio) of the Company\u2019s annual excess cash flow;\n\u25cf\n100\n%\n of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales by the Company and its restricted subsidiaries (including casualty and condemnation events, subject to de minimis thresholds), and subject to the right to reinvest \n100\n%\n of such proceeds, subject to certain qualifications; and\n\u25cf\n100\n%\n of the net proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt by the Company or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than certain debt permitted under the Credit Agreement.\nThe foregoing mandatory prepayments will be used to reduce the installments of principal payments on the Senior Secured Term Loan. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, except for customary \u201cbreakage\u201d costs with respect to SOFR loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nThe Senior Secured Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company\u2019s option, either (1)\u00a0an applicable margin plus a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a)\u00a0\n0.50\n% per annum plus the Federal Funds Effective Rate, (b)\u00a0the prime rate announced by the Administrative Agent from time to time and (c)\u00a0\n1.00\n% per annum plus Adjusted Term SOFR (as defined below) for a 1-month tenor or (2) Term SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of \n0.11448\n% per annum, \n0.26161\n% per annum, and \n0.42826\n% per annum for interest periods of one-month, three months, or six-months or longer, respectively (\u201cAdjusted Term SOFR\u201d) plus (x) in the case of the Senior Secured Term Loans, \n2.0\n% for base rate loans or \n3.0\n% for SOFR loans or (y) in the case of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, an applicable margin based on the Secured Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The rate in effect for the outstanding Senior Secured Term Loan due 2026 was \n8.47\n% per annum at \nDecember 31, 2023, and \n7.27\n%\n per annum at December 31, 2022.\n\u200b\nThe Credit Agreement contains other customary terms, including (1)\u00a0representations, warranties and affirmative covenants, (2)\u00a0negative covenants, including limitations on indebtedness, liens, mergers and acquisitions, asset sales, investments, distributions, prepayments of subordinated debt and transactions with affiliates, in each case subject to baskets, thresholds and other exceptions, and (3)\u00a0customary events of default.\n\u200b\nThe availability of certain baskets and the ability to enter into certain transactions will also be subject to compliance with certain financial ratios. In addition, the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility includes a financial covenant that requires, in certain circumstances, compliance with a certain secured leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was in a covenant suspension period under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility as described above.\nFirst Lien Notes Due 2029. \nOn February 14, 2022, the Company issued $\n950.0\n million aggregate principal amount of its \n7.5\n% First Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2029 (\u201cFirst Lien Notes due 2029\u201d), pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 14, 2022, among the Company, the guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent. The Company used the net proceeds from the sale of the notes, and cash on hand, to fund the full redemption of the then outstanding $\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s \n10.5\n% First Lien Notes due 2025 (\u201cFirst Lien Notes due 2025\u201d), the then outstanding $\n300\n million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s \n10.5\n% First Lien Notes due 2026 (\u201cFirst Lien Notes due 2026\u201d), and the then outstanding $\n73.5\n million aggregate principal amount of the Company\u2019s \n15\n%/\n17\n% Cash/PIK Toggle First Lien Secured Notes due 2026 (\u201cFirst Lien Toggle Notes due 2026\u201d) and to pay related accrued interest, fees, costs, premiums and expenses. The Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment related to this transaction $\n135.0\n million in other expense during the year ended December 31, 2022. The deferred charges will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the First Lien Notes due 2029 using the effective interest method. \n103\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe First Lien Notes due 2029 bear cash interest at a rate of \n7.5\n% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15, beginning on August 15, 2022. The First Lien Notes due 2029 have not been registered under the Securities Act, as amended, and will mature on February 15, 2029. The Company may redeem some or all of the First Lien Notes due 2029 at any time on or after February 15, 2025, at the redemption prices equal to (i) \n103.750\n% for the twelve-month period beginning on February 15, 2025; (ii) \n101.875\n% for the twelve-month period beginning on February 15, 2026, and (iii) \n100.0\n% at any time thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, the Company may redeem up to \n35\n% of the aggregate principal amount of the First Lien Notes due 2029 using net proceeds from certain equity offerings completed prior to February 15, 2025 at a redemption price equal to \n107.5\n%\n of their aggregate principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including the date of redemption. The Company may redeem some or all of the First  Lien Notes due 2029 at any time prior to February 15, 2025 at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of their aggregate principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption, plus an applicable make-whole premium. Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture governing the First Lien Notes due 2029), the Company must offer to purchase the First Lien Notes due 2029 at a purchase price equal to \n101\n% of the principal amounts, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe First Lien Notes due 2029 are general senior secured obligations of the Company and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior secured basis by all of the Company\u2019s existing and future subsidiaries that guarantee the Company\u2019s other indebtedness, including the Company\u2019s Senior Secured Credit Facilities.

For the first interest period ended July 15, 2021, the Company elected to pay in PIK interest.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reclassified  prepaid commitment fees and deferred charges of \n$\n28.6\n million from other long-term assets to corporate borrowings. The prepaid commitment fees were recorded as a discount and, together with deferred charges, were amortized to interest expense over the term of the First Lien Toggle Notes due 2026 using the effective interest method. \nConvertible Notes due 2026.\n  Concurrently with the Exchange Offers, to obtain the consent of the holders of the \n2.95\n% Convertible Notes due 2024 (\u201cConvertible Notes due 2024\u201d), the Company restructured $\n600.0\n million of Convertible Notes due 2024 issued in 2018 to Silver Lake Group, L.L.C. (\u201cSilver Lake\u201d) and others pursuant to which the maturity of the Convertible Notes due 2024 were extended to May 1, 2026 (the \u201cConvertible Notes due 2026\u201d) and a first-priority lien on the collateral securing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was granted to secured indebtedness thereunder. The Convertible Notes due 2026 were issued pursuant to an amended and restated indenture, dated as of July 31, 2020, among the Company, the guarantors named therein and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee and collateral agent. The Convertible Notes due 2026 were convertible at the option of the holders thereof. The Convertible Notes due 2026 bore cash interest at a rate of \n2.95\n% per annum, semi-annually in arrears on September 15\nth\n and March 15\nth\n, commencing on September 15, 2020.\nOn January 27, 2021, affiliates of Silver Lake and certain co-investors (collectively, the \u201cNoteholders\u201d) elected to convert (the \u201cConvertible Note Conversion\u201d) all $\n600.0\n million principal amount of the Company\u2019s Convertible Notes due 2026 into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock at a conversion price of $\n67.60\n per share. The non-cash Convertible Note Conversion settled on January 29, 2021, and resulted in the issuance of \n4,442,286\n shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and \n4,442,286\n of the Company\u2019s AMC Preferred Equity Units to the Noteholders. The Company recorded approximately $\n71.0\n million of non-cash interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 for unamortized discount and deferred charges at the date of conversion following the guidance in ASC 815-15-40-1. Pursuant to the Stock Repurchase and Cancellation Agreement with Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd. (\u201cWanda\u201d) dated as of September 14, 2018, \n566,600\n shares of the Company\u2019s Class B common stock and \n566,600\n AMC Preferred Equity Units held by Wanda were forfeited and cancelled in connection with the Convertible Note Conversion. \n\u200b\n109\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOdeon Term Loan Facility.\n  On February 15, 2021, OCGL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a new \n\u00a3\n140.0\n million and \u20ac\n296.0\n million term loan facility agreement (the \u201cOdeon Term Loan Facility\u201d), by and among OCGL, the subsidiaries of OCGL party thereto, the lenders and other loan parties thereto and Lucid Agency Services Limited as agent and Lucid Trustee Services Limited as security agent. Approximately \u00a3\n89.7\n million and \u20ac\n12.8\n million of the net proceeds from the Odeon Term Loan Facility were used to repay in full Odeon\u2019s obligations (including principal, interest, fees and cash collateralized letters of credit) under its then-existing revolving credit facility and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The Company recorded deferred financing costs of $\n1.0\n million in other expense during the year ended December 31, 2021. Borrowings under the Odeon Term Loan Facility bore interest at a rate equal to \n10.75\n% per annum during the first year and \n11.25\n% thereafter and each interest period was \nthree months\n, or such other period agreed between the Company and the Agent. The interest could be capitalized on the last day of each interest period and added to the outstanding principal amount at OCGL\u2019s election. For the first interest period ending May 2021 and the second interest period ending August 2021, OCGL elected to pay in PIK interest. OCGL paid cash interest with respect to the third interest period ending November 2021. The principal amount of new funding was prior to deducting discounts of $\n19.4\n million and deferred financing costs of $\n16.5\n million related to the Odeon Term Loan Facility. The discount and deferred financing costs were amortized to interest expense over the term using the effective interest method. On October 20, 2022, the Company completely repaid the Odeon Term Loan Facility using existing cash and $\n363.0\n million net proceeds from the issuance of the Odeon Notes due 2027.\nFinancial Covenants\nThe Company believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to comply with the minimum liquidity requirement under its Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility through the end of the covenant suspension period. Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, the requisite revolving lenders party thereto agreed to extend the suspension period for the secured leverage ratio financial covenant applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement through March 31, 2024. The current maturity date of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is April 22, 2024 and we currently do not expect to extend such maturity or replace the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility upon such maturity. The financial covenant applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been (or were required to have been) delivered, thus the financial covenant has been effectively suspended through maturity of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2023, the Company was subject to a minimum liquidity requirement of $\n100\n million as a condition to the financial covenant suspension period under the Credit Agreement. \n\u200b\n110\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nNOTE 9\u2014STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT\n\u200b\nShare Rights and Privileges\nCommon Stock\nHolders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock are entitled to \none\n vote per each share. Holders of Common Stock share ratably (based on the number of shares of Common Stock held) in any dividend declared by its board of directors, subject to any preferential rights of any outstanding preferred stock. The Common Stock is not convertible into any other shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock. \nClass B Common Stock\nOn January 27, 2021, pursuant to the Stock Repurchase and Cancellation Agreement with Wanda dated as of September 14, 2018, and in connection with the Convertible Note Conversion of the Convertible Notes due 2026 into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock by Silver Lake and certain co-investors, \n566,600\n shares of the Company\u2019s Class B common stock and \n566,600\n AMC Preferred Equity Units held by Wanda were forfeited and cancelled.\nOn February 1, 2021, Wanda exercised their right to convert all outstanding Class B common stock of \n4,610,379\n and \n4,610,379\n of AMC Preferred Equity Units to Common Stock thereby reducing the number of outstanding Class B common stock to zero, which resulted in the retirement of Class B common stock. The Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation provides that Class B common stock may not be reissued by the Company.\nAMC Preferred Equity Units \nEach AMC Preferred Equity Unit was a depositary share and represented an interest in a share of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock evidenced by a depositary receipt pursuant to a deposit agreement. Each AMC Preferred Equity Unit was designed to have the same economic and voting rights as a share Common Stock. \nPreferred Stock\nThe Company has \n50,000,000\n authorized shares of preferred stock, \nnone\n of which are issued or \noutstanding\n as of December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, there were \n50,000,000\n authorized shares of preferred stock, \n10,000,000\n of which had been allocated to the Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock.\nSpecial Meeting of Stockholders\nThe Company\u2019s board of directors called a special meeting of the Company\u2019s stockholders on March 14, 2023 (the \u201cSpecial Meeting\u201d). At the Special Meeting, the Company\u2019s stockholders approved the following proposals:\n1.\nProposal No. 1: To approve an amendment to our Third Amended and Restate Certificate of Incorporation (\u201cCertificate of Incorporation\u201d) to increase the total number of authorized shares of Common Stock from \n524,173,073\n shares of Common Stock to \n550,000,000\n shares of Common Stock (the \u201cShare Increase\u201d);\n2.\nProposal No. 2: To approve an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate a reverse stock split at a ratio of \none\n share of Common Stock for every ten shares of Common Stock, which together with the Share Increase, shall permit the full conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock (the \u201cReverse Stock Split\u201d and collectively with the Share Increase, the \u201cCharter Amendments\u201d); and\n3.\nProposal No. 3: To approve one or more adjournments of the Special Meeting, if necessary, to permit further solicitation of proxies if there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Special Meeting to approve and adopt the Charter Amendments.\nEach of the Share Increase and the Reverse Stock Split is cross-conditioned on the approval of the other, such that approval of both proposals was required for each of them to take effect.\n111\n\n\nTable of Contents\nShareholder Litigation\nTwo\n putative stockholder class actions were filed in the Delaware Chancery Court that assert a breach of fiduciary duty against certain of the Company\u2019s directors and a claim for breach of \n8 Del. C. \u00a7 242 \nagainst those directors and the Company, arising out of the Company\u2019s creation of AMC Preferred Equity Units, the transactions between the Company and Antara that the Company announced on December 22, 2022 (the \u201cAntara Transactions\u201d), and the Charter Amendments.\nThis litigation prevented the Company from immediately implementing the Charter Amendments. On April 2, 2023, the parties entered into a binding settlement term sheet to settle the litigation and allow implementation of the Charter Amendments. On August 11, 2023, the Delaware Chancery Court approved the settlement and on August 21, 2023, the Delaware Supreme Court confirmed the ruling of the Chancery Court. Pursuant to the settlement term sheet, record holders of Common Stock at the close of business on August 24, 2023, after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split, but prior to the conversion of AMC Preferred Equity Units into Common Stock (\u201cSettlement Payment Recipients\u201d), received a payment of \none\n share of Common Stock for every 7.5 shares of Common Stock owned by such Settlement Payment Recipients (the \u201cSettlement Payment\u201d). On August 28, 2023, the Company made the settlement payment and issued \n6,897,018\n shares of Common Stock. See Note 11\u2014Commitments and Contingencies for further information regarding the litigation and settlement. \nCharter Amendments and AMC Preferred Equity Unit Conversion\nOn August 14, 2023, the Company filed an amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation to effectuate the Charter Amendments as of August 24, 2023. The Charter Amendments permitted the conversion of all of the Company\u2019s outstanding AMC Preferred Equity Units into shares of Common Stock (the \u201cConversion\u201d). On August 25, 2023, \n99,540,642\n shares of Common Stock were issued as part of the Conversion. On August 25, 2023, AMC Preferred Equity Units ceased trading and were subsequently delisted from the NYSE. On August 25, 2023, the Company filed a Certificate of Elimination of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock with the Secretary of State of Delaware that eliminated the Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock from the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation. \nAMC\u2019s Board of Directors approved equitable adjustments to all outstanding awards under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan subsequent to the effectiveness of the Charter Amendments. The outstanding awards were proportionally adjusted consistent with the ratio used for the Reverse Stock Split and all awards previously convertible into AMC Preferred Equity Units are now convertible into Common Stock.\nStock Split and Reverse Stock Split\nOn August 4, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a special dividend of \none\n AMC Preferred Equity Unit for each share of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on August 15, 2022, the record date. The dividend was paid at the close of business on August 19, 2022 to investors who held Common Stock as of August 22, 2022, the ex-dividend date. Due to the characteristics of the AMC Preferred Equity Units, the special dividend had the effect of a stock split pursuant to ASC 505-20-25-4. \nOn August 24, 2023, the Company effectuated a reverse stock split at a ratio of \none\n share of Common Stock for every ten shares of Common Stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, each share of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock became convertible into ten shares of Common Stock, and by extension each AMC Preferred Equity Unit became equivalent to \none\n-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock. The reverse stock split did not impact the number of AMC Preferred Equity Units outstanding. The Company concluded that this change in conversion ratio is analogous to a reverse stock split of the AMC Preferred Equity Units even though the reverse stock split did not have an effect on the number of AMC Preferred Equity Units outstanding.\nAccordingly, all references made to share, per share, unit, per unit, or common share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect both the effects of the special dividend as a stock split and the subsequent reverse stock split. References made to AMC Preferred Equity Units have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of the reverse stock split on their equivalent Common Stock shares.\n112\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAt-The-Market Share Issuances\n \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company entered into various equity distribution agreements with sales agents to sell shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and AMC Preferred Equity Units, from time to time, through \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering programs. Subject to the terms and conditions of the equity distribution agreements, the sales agents used reasonable efforts consistent with their normal trading and sales practices, applicable law and regulations, and the rules of the NYSE to sell the Common Stock and AMC Preferred Equity Units from time to time based upon the Company\u2019s instructions for the sales, including any price, time or size limits specified by the Company.

The Company accounts for forfeitures when they occur.\n\u200b\n114\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPlan Amendment due to Stock Split\nThe 2013 Plan contemplates equitable adjustments for certain transactions such as a stock split. On August 19, 2022, the Compensation Committee approved an adjustment to the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan to entitle each participant \none\n AMC Preferred Equity Unit and \none\n share of Common Stock for each RSU or PSU for awards granted prior to the AMC Preferred Equity Unit special dividend. The Company determined that this modification was a Type 1 (probable-to-probable) modification that did not increase the fair value of the award and therefore did not require additional stock-based compensation expense to be recognized. \nSpecial Awards\nOn February 23, 2023, AMC\u2019s Board of Directors approved special awards in lieu of vesting of the 2022 PSU awards. The special awards were accounted for as modification to the 2022 PSU awards which lowered the Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow performance targets such that \n200\n% vesting was achieved for both tranches. This modification resulted in the immediate additional vesting of \n238,959\n Common Stock 2022 PSUs and \n238,959\n AMC Preferred Equity Unit 2022 PSUs. This was treated as a Type 3 modification (improbable-to-probable) which requires the Company to recognize additional stock compensation expense based on the modification date fair values of the Common Stock PSUs and AMC Preferred Equity Units PSUs of $\n14.9\n million and $\n5.3\n million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recognized $\n20.2\n million of stock compensation expense related to these awards.\nAwards Granted in 2023, 2022, and 2021 and Other Activity\n\u200b\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors approved awards of stock, RSUs, and PSUs to certain of the Company\u2019s employees and directors under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan. Each RSU or PSU is convertible into \none\n share of Common Stock upon vesting. \nEach RSU and PSU held by a participant as of a dividend record date is entitled to a dividend equivalent equal to the amount paid in respect to \none\n share of Common Stock underlying the unit. Any such accrued dividend equivalents are paid to the holder only upon vesting of the units. \nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors also granted awards to certain non-section 16 officers that are expected to be settled in cash. Upon vesting, participants receiving cash settlement were initially set to receive an amount of cash equal to the closing price of an AMC Preferred Equity Unit multiplied by the number of underlying cash-based RSUs and PSUs awarded. Following the completion of the Charter Amendments, grantees will now receive an amount of cash equal to the closing price of Common Stock multiplied by the number of underlying cash-based RSUs and PSUs awarded. These awards have been classified as liabilities and are include within accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The vesting requirements and vesting periods are identical to the equity classified awards described below. The Company recognizes expense related to these awards based on the fair value of the Common Stock shares, giving effect to the portion of services rendered during the requisite services period. As of December 31, 2023, there were \n81,691\n nonvested underlying Common Stock RSUs and PSUs (after giving effect to the actual 2023 PSU attainment levels) related to awards granted to certain non-section 16 officers. There are \n52,001\n nonvested underlying Common Stock RSUs and PSUs (2023 Tranche Year, after giving effect to the actual 2023 PSU attainment) that are currently classified as liabilities and \n29,690\n nonvested underlying Common Stock PSUs (2024 & 2025 Tranche Year) which have not been granted for accounting purposes as the performance targets for the 2024 and 2025 PSU Tranche Years have yet to be established. \n\u200b\n115\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe awards granted under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan generally had the following features:\n\u25cf\nBoard of Director Stock Awards:\n  The Company granted fully vested shares of Common Stock and AMC Preferred Equity Units to its independent members of AMC\u2019s Board of Directors during the years ended December 31, 2023, Decembers 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021 as follows:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDecember 31, 2023\n\u200b\nDecember 31, 2022\n\u200b\nDecember 31, 2021\nCommon Stock\n\u200b\n \n8,560\n\u200b\n \n4,165\n\u200b\n \n12,405\nAMC Preferred Equity Units\n\u200b\n \n15,376\n\u200b\n \n4,165\n\u200b\n \n12,405\n\u200b\n\u25cf\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards:\n  The Company granted RSU awards of \n354,015\n, \n139,427\n, and \n537,563\n RSU with grant date fair values of \n$\n12.4\n \nmillion, \n$\n13.6\n million, and \n$\n20.7\n million to certain members of management during the years ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, respectively. The Company records stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line recognition method over the requisite vesting period. The RSUs granted during 2023, 2022, and 2021 vest over \nthree years\n with \n1/3\n vesting in each year. These RSUs will be settled within \n30\n days of vesting. \n\u25cf\nPerformance Stock Unit Awards:\n \n2023 PSU Awards.\n During 2023, \n327,758\n total PSUs were awarded (\u201c2023 PSU award\u201d) to certain members of management and executive officers, with the total PSUs divided into \nthree\n separate year tranches, with each tranche allocated to a fiscal year within the performance period (\u201cTranche Year\u201d). The PSUs within each Tranche Year are further divided between two performance targets; the Adjusted EBITDA performance target and free cash flow performance target. The 2023 PSU awards will vest if \n80\n% to \n120\n% of the performance targets are attained, with the corresponding vested unit amount ranging from \n50\n% to \n200\n% of the PSUs awarded. If the performance targets for each Tranche Year are attained at \n100\n%, the 2023 PSU awards will vest \n327,758\n units in the aggregate. \nNo\n PSUs will vest for each Tranche Year if the Company does not achieve 80% of the Tranche Year\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA or free cash flow targets.\nThe Compensation Committee establishes the annual performance targets at the beginning of each year. Therefore, the grant date (and fair value measurement date) for each Tranche Year is the date at the beginning of each year when a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions are reached per ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. The 2023 PSU award grant date fair value for the 2023 Tranche Year award of \n109,264\n units was approximately $\n4.1\n million measured at \n100\n% attainment of the performance targets. The 2022 PSU award grant date fair value for the 2023 Tranche Year of \n46,179\n units was approximately $\n2.0\n million measured at \n100\n% attainment of the performance targets. The 2021 PSU award grant date fair value for the 2023 Tranche Year of \n160,181\n units was approximately $\n6.8\n million measured at \n100\n% attainment of the performance targets. \nAt December 31, 2023, the 2023 Tranche Year performance targets for both the annual Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow were attained at \n86\n% and \n0\n%, respectively.\n2022 PSU Awards. \nDuring 2022, \n139,427\n total PSUs were awarded (\u201c2022 PSU award\u201d) to certain members of management and executive officers, with the total PSUs divided into \nthree\n Tranche Years. The PSUs within each Tranche Year are further divided between two performance targets; the Adjusted EBITDA performance target and free cash flow performance target. The 2022 PSU awards will vest if \n80\n% to \n120\n% of the performance targets are attained, with the corresponding vested unit amount ranging from \n50\n% to \n200\n% of the PSUs awarded. If the performance targets for each Tranche Year are attained at 100%, the 2022 PSU awards will vest at \n139,427\n units in the aggregate. \nNo\n PSUs will vest for each Tranche Year if the Company does not achieve 80% of the Tranche Year\u2019s Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow targets. \n2021 PSU Awards.\n During 2021, \n537,563\n total PSUs were awarded (\u201c2021 PSU award\u201d) to certain members of management and executive officers, with the total PSUs divided into \nthree\n Tranche Years. The PSUs within each Tranche Year are further divided between two performance targets; the Adjusted EBITDA performance target and free cash flow performance target. The 2021 PSU awards will vest if \n80\n% to \n120\n% of the performance targets are attained, with the corresponding vested unit amount ranging from \n50\n% to \n200\n% of the PSUs awarded.

The service condition modification included separating the vesting period subject to the participant\u2019s continued employment through the end of the \nthree-year\n cumulative period into \nthree\n separate year service periods applicable to each tranche year. The Company accounted for the modification in accordance with ASC 718-20, Compensation-Stock Compensation, as a Type I modification (probable-to-probable) with no change to the fair value measurement of the awards.\n2020 PSU Awards:\n During the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, PSU awards of \n287,260\n were granted to certain members of management and executive officers, with \nthree-year\n cumulative Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January\u00a01, 2020 and ending on December\u00a031, 2022, prior to the service condition and performance condition modifications on November 3, 2021 and October 30, 2020, respectively. \n2019 PSU Awards: \nDuring the year ended December\u00a031, 2019, PSU awards of \n146,034\n were granted to certain members of management and executive officers, with \nthree-year\n cumulative Adjusted EBITDA and diluted earnings per share performance target conditions and service conditions, covering a performance period beginning January\u00a01, 2019 and ending on December\u00a031, 2021, prior to the service condition and performance condition modifications on November 3, 2021 and October 30, 2020, respectively.\nOctober 30, 2020 modification.\n On October 30, 2020, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a modification to the PSUs for the awards granted in 2018, 2019, and 2020. The modification included separating the \nthree-year\n cumulative performance targets into three separate year performance targets applicable to each tranche year. In addition, the service conditions were modified, and vesting is now subject to the participant\u2019s continued employment through the end of the \nthree-year\n cumulative period. The Company accounted for the modification in accordance with ASC 718-20, Compensation-Stock Compensation, as an exchange of the original award, that was not expected to vest, for a new award. The Company measured the fair value of the new award on the modification date, October 30, 2020, because the Company determined that achieving performance thresholds were probable for certain tranche awards.\n\u25cf\nSpecial Performance Stock Unit Executive Award Agreement:  \nDuring the year ended December\u00a031, 2019, a PSU market condition award of \n600,000\n was granted to an executive officer of the Company that would vest based upon achieving target prices for the Company\u2019s Common Stock. This award was subsequently cancelled and replaced with the PSU market condition award granted on February 26, 2020.\nOn February 26, 2020 and March 5, 2020, special performance stock unit awards (\u201cSPSUs\u201d), totaling \n714,000\n units were granted to certain executive officers that vest based upon achieving target prices for the Company\u2019s Class Common Stock. \nOn October 30, 2020, based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a modification to the SPSUs for the awards. Each SPSU award agreement was amended as follows:\n\u25cf\nThe stock price thresholds (ranging from \n$\n12\n to \n$\n24\n) and service requirement for tranches 1 through 4 of the SPSUs were eliminated and such SPSUs vested on October 30, 2020; \n\u25cf\nParticipants shall be prohibited from selling the shares of Common Stock issued upon the foregoing vesting until October 30, 2021;  \n\u25cf\nThe stock price threshold for tranche 5 of the SPSUs was changed to \n$\n4\n from \n$\n28\n and the stock price threshold for tranche 6 of the SPSUs was changed to \n$\n8\n from \n$\n32\n; and \n\u25cf\nThe service requirement for tranches 5 and 6 was shortened to end on October 30, 2021. \nAs a result of the SPSU modification of market conditions, the incremental fair value amount assigned to the grant date fair value was approximately $\n7.3\n million in accordance with ASC 718-20, Compensation-Stock Compensation. In January 2021, the market condition requirement for SPSUs was met as a result of exceeding the \n20-day\n trailing volume weighted average stock price threshold target for tranche 5 and \n117\n\n\nTable of Contents\ntranche 6 of $\n4\n and $\n8\n, respectively. The stock-based compensation costs for SPSUs were recorded on a straight-line basis through October 30, 2021, which was the end of the service requirement period.\nThe following table represents the nonvested RSU and PSU activity for the years ended December\u00a031, 2023, December\u00a031, 2022 and December\u00a031, 2021:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nWeighted\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nAverage\n\u200b\n\u200b\nCommon Stock\n\u200b\nGrant\u00a0Date\n\u200b\n\u200b\nRSUs and PSUs (4)\n\u200b\nFair\u00a0Value\nBeginning balance at January 1, 2021 \n(1)\n\u200b\n \n831,821\n\u200b\n$\n \n27.55\nGranted\n\u200b\n \n1,017,985\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n38.50\nVested\n\u200b\n (\n129,773\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n14.10\nForfeited\n\u200b\n (\n43,355\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n53.70\nCancelled\n (2)\n\u200b\n (\n108,226\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n14.05\nNonvested at January 1, 2022\n\u200b\n \n1,568,452\n\u200b\n$\n \n39.60\nGranted\n\u200b\n \n167,679\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n97.50\nVested\n\u200b\n (\n563,634\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n35.90\nForfeited\n\u200b\n (\n71,688\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n58.60\nCancelled\n (2)\n\u200b\n (\n474,659\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n35.90\nNonvested at January 1, 2023\n\u200b\n \n626,150\n\u200b\n$\n \n59.10\nGranted\n (3)\n\u200b\n \n517,067\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n36.73\nGranted - Special Award\n\u200b\n \n477,918\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n42.25\nVested\n\u200b\n (\n222,920\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n57.43\nVested - Special Award\n\u200b\n (\n257,945\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n42.18\nForfeited (3)\n\u200b\n (\n22,119\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n45.32\nCancelled (\n2)\n\u200b\n (\n150,755\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n60.14\nCancelled - Special Award \n(2)\n\u200b\n (\n219,973\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n42.34\nNonvested at December\u00a031, 2023\n\u200b\n \n747,423\n\u200b\n$\n \n44.35\nTranche Years 2024 and 2025 awarded under the 2023 PSU award and Tranche Year 2024 awarded under the 2022 PSU award with grant date fair values to be determined  in years 2024 and 2025, respectively\n\u200b\n \n254,754\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nTotal Nonvested at December\u00a031, 2023\n\u200b\n \n1,002,177\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n(1)\nIncludes awards modified during 2020 where grant date fair value was not determined until 2021.\n(2)\nRepresents vested RSUs, PSUs, and SPSUs surrendered in lieu of taxes and cancelled awards returned to the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan.\n(3)\nThe number of PSU shares granted and forfeited under the Tranche Year 2023 is based on attainment of performance targets at \n86\n% \nfor the Adjusted EBITDA target and \n0\n%\n for the free cash flow target. \n(4)\nIncludes AMC Preferred Equity Unit RSUs and PSUs that were converted to Common Stock RSUs and PSUs as a result of the Charter Amendments.\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n118\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nNOTE 10\u2014INCOME TAXES\nCurrent income tax expense represents the amounts expected to be reported on the Company\u2019s income tax returns, and deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded as appropriate to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount considered likely to be realized.\nThe Company evaluates its deferred tax assets each period to determine if a valuation allowance is required based on whether it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that some portion of the deferred tax assets would not be realized. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income during future periods on a federal, state and foreign jurisdiction basis. The Company conducts its evaluation by considering all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and the outlooks for the U.S. motion picture and broader economy, among others. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended December 31, 2023 for each taxing jurisdiction. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence, such as the Company\u2019s projections of future taxable income. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company remained in a cumulative loss over the past three-year period for the U.S. and international jurisdictions except for Finland.\nThe Company maintains a valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets as well as international jurisdictions in which it operates, with the exception of Finland. \nThe actual effective rate for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023 was (\n0.9\n)%. The Company\u2019s consolidated tax rate for the year ended December\u00a031, 2023 differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to the valuation allowances in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, foreign tax rate differences, and federal and state tax credits, partially offset by permanent differences related to interest, compensation, and other discrete items. At December 31, 2023 and December\u00a031, 2022, the Company has recorded net deferred tax liabilities of $\n32.4\n\u00a0million and of $\n32.1\n\u00a0million, respectively.\nThe income tax provision

An IRS examination of the tax year March\u00a029, 2012 was settled in 2021 resulting in additional federal and state net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d). Generally, tax years beginning after December\u00a031, 2003 are still open to examination by various taxing authorities. Additionally, as discussed above, the Company has NOL carryforwards for tax years ended December\u00a031, 2004 through December\u00a031, 2023, in the U.S. and various state jurisdictions which have carryforwards of varying lengths of time. These NOLs are subject to adjustment based on the statute of limitations applicable to the return in which they are utilized, not the year in which they are generated. Various state, local and foreign income tax returns are also under examination by taxing authorities. The Company does not believe that the outcome of any examination will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nUtilization of the Company\u2019s net operating loss carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforward and other tax attributes became subject to the Section 382 ownership change limitation due to changes in our stock ownership on January 29, 2021.

If management believes that a loss arising from these actions is probable and can reasonably be estimated, the Company records the amount of the loss, or the minimum estimated liability when the loss is estimated using a range and no point is more probable than another. As additional information becomes available, any potential liability related to these actions is assessed and the estimates are revised, if necessary. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of such matters discussed below, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position or overall trends in results of operations. However, litigation and claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable outcomes can occur. An unfavorable outcome might include monetary damages. If an unfavorable outcome were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the results of operations in the period in which the outcome occurs or in future periods. \nOn January\u00a012, 2018 and January\u00a019, 2018, \ntwo\n putative federal securities class actions, captioned \nHawaii Structural Ironworkers Pension Trust Fund v.

On March 21, 2023, the court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss.\nOn June 14, 2023, the parties to the Gantulga, Kenna, Manuel, Dinkevich, and Lyon Actions signed a stipulation of settlement which, subject to the approval of the court, would resolve those actions. As consideration for the proposed settlement, the Company agreed to certain corporate governance reforms. The Company also agreed to the payment of a $\n1.0\n million fee and expense award to the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys to be paid by the Company\u2019s directors\u2019 and officer\u2019s insurance carriers. Defendants agreed to the settlement solely to eliminate the burden, expense, and uncertainties inherent in further litigation. Defendants have denied, and continue to deny, all allegations of wrongdoing, fault, liability, or damages with respect to the matters alleged in the Gantulga, Kenna, Manuel, Dinkevich, and Lyon Actions. On June 23, 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion to preliminarily approve the settlement. On October 6, 2023, the Court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement as being fair, reasonable, and adequate, and scheduled a telephonic hearing for December 18, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. eastern time, to, among other things, consider whether to approve the proposed settlement. On December 18, 2023, the court issued an order and final judgement approving the proposed settlement.\nOn April 22, 2019, a putative stockholder class and derivative complaint, captioned \nLao v. Dalian Wanda Group Co., Ltd.\n, et al., C.A. No. 2019-0303-JRS (the \u201cLao Action\u201d), was filed against certain of the Company\u2019s directors, Wanda, two of Wanda\u2019s affiliates, Silver Lake, and one of Silver Lake\u2019s affiliates in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Lao Action asserted claims directly, on behalf of a putative class of Company stockholders, and derivatively, on behalf of the Company, for breaches of fiduciary duty and aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to transactions that the Company entered into with affiliates of Wanda and Silver Lake on September\u00a014, 2018, and the special cash dividend of $\n1.55\n per share of Common Stock that was payable on September\u00a028, 2018 to the Company\u2019s stockholders of record as of September 25, 2018. On July\u00a018, 2019, the Company\u2019s Board of Directors formed a Special Litigation Committee to investigate and evaluate the claims and allegations asserted in the Lao Action and make a determination as to how the Company should proceed with respect to the Lao Action. On January 8, 2021, the Special Litigation Committee filed a report with the court recommending that the court dismiss all of the claims asserted in the Lao Action, and moved to dismiss all of the claims in the Lao Action. On June 6, 2022, the parties signed a stipulation of settlement to resolve the Lao Action for $\n17.4\n million (the \u201cSettlement Amount\u201d). Defendants agreed to the settlement and the payment of the Settlement Amount solely to eliminate the burden, expense, and uncertainty of further litigation, and continue to expressly deny any liability or wrongdoing with respect to the matters alleged in the Lao Action. On September 28, 2022, the court held a hearing to consider whether to approve the proposed settlement. At the hearing, the court requested a supplemental notice to stockholders prior to approval. A second hearing regarding approval of the settlement was held on November 30, 2022. Following the hearing, also on November 30, 2022, the court issued an order and final judgment approving the settlement and dismissing the action. The order and final judgment included a fee and expense award to plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the amount of $\n3.4\n million to be paid out of the Settlement Amount. On January 6, 2023, the remainder of the Settlement Amount of $\n14.0\n million was paid to the Company. The Company recorded the settlement as a gain in other income during the year ended December 31, 2023. \n123\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOn December 27, 2022, the Company received a letter from a purported stockholder, demanding to inspect certain of the Company\u2019s books and records pursuant to 8\u00a0\nDel. C.\n\u00a0\u00a7 220 in order to investigate allegations concerning: (i) the proposal that was approved by the Board on January 27, 2021 to amend the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation to increase the total number of shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock; (ii) the Company\u2019s creation, distribution, and/or sale of AMC Preferred Equity Units (\u201cAPEs\u201d); (iii) the Antara Transactions; (iv) the\n special meeting of the holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock and APEs to be held on March 14, 2023 for the purpose of voting on amendments to the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation that, together, would enable the APEs to convert into shares of the Company\u2019s Common Stock: and (v) the independence of \nthe members of the Board \n(the \u201cDecember 27, 2022 Demand\u201d). On January 4, 2023, the Company rejected the December 27, 2022 Demand. On February 7, 2023, \nwithout conceding the propriety of the \nDecember 27, 2022 Demand\n in any respect and while reserving all rights, the Company, in an effort to avoid unnecessary litigation, allowed the stockholder who made the \nDecember 27, 2022 Demand \nto inspect certain of the Company\u2019s books and records concerning the subject matter of \nDecember 27, 2022 Demand.\nOn February 6, 2023, the \nCompany received a letter from another purported stockholder, demanding to inspect certain of the Company\u2019s books and records pursuant to 8\u00a0\nDel. C.\n\u00a0\u00a7 220 in order to investigate allegations similar to those made in the December 27, 2022 Demand (the \u201cFebruary 6, 2023 Demand\u201d and, together with the December 27, 2022 Demand, the \u201cBooks and Records Demands\u201d). On February 13, 2023, the Company rejected the February 6, 2023 Demand. Also, on February 13, 2023, without conceding the propriety of the February 6, 2023 Demand in any respect and while reserving all rights, the Company, in an effort to avoid unnecessary litigation, allowed the stockholder who made the February 6, 2023 \nDemand \nto inspect the same books and records that it allowed the stockholder who made the \nDecember 27, 2022 Demand \nto inspect.  \nOn February 20, 2023, \ntwo\n putative stockholder class actions were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned \nAllegheny County Employees\u2019 Retirement System v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc., et al.\n, C.A. No. 2023-0215-MTZ (Del. Ch.) (the \u201c\nAllegheny\n Action\u201d), and \nMunoz v. Adam M. Aron, et al.\n, C.A. No. 2023-0216-MTZ (Del. Ch.) (the \u201c\nMunoz \nAction\u201d) and which were subsequently consolidated into \nIn re AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. Stockholder Litigation\n C.A. No. 2023-0215-MTZ (Del. Ch.) (the \u201cShareholder Litigation\u201d). The \nAllegheny\n Action asserted a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against certain of the Company\u2019s directors and a claim for breach of 8 \nDel. C.\n \u00a7 242 against those directors and the Company, arising out of the Company\u2019s creation of the APEs, the Antara Transactions, and the Charter Amendments. The \nMunoz\n Action, which was filed by the stockholders who made the Books and Records Demands, asserted a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the Company\u2019s current directors and former director Lee Wittlinger, arising out of the same conduct challenged in the \nAllegheny\n Action. The \nAllegheny \nAction sought a declaration that the issuance of the APEs violated 8 \nDel. C.\n \u00a7 242(b), an order that holders of the Company\u2019s Common Stock be provided with a separate vote from the holders of the APEs on the Charter Amendments or that the APEs be enjoined from voting on the Charter Amendments, and an award of money damages. The Munoz \nAction \nsought to enjoin the APEs from being voted on the Charter Amendments.  \nOn February 27, 2023, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered a status quo order that (i) allowed the March 14, 2023 vote on the Charter Amendments to proceed, but precluded the Company from implementing the Charter Amendments pending a ruling by the court on the plaintiffs\u2019 then-anticipated preliminary injunction motion, and (ii) scheduled a hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 then-anticipated preliminary injunction motion for April 27, 2023 (the \u201cStatus Quo Order\u201d).\nOn April 2, 2023, the parties entered into a binding settlement term sheet to settle the Shareholder Litigation, which among other things, provided that the parties would jointly request that the Status Quo Order be lifted. Pursuant to the term sheet, the Company agreed, following and subject to AMC\u2019s completion of the Conversion and Reverse Stock Split, to make a non-cash settlement payment to record holders of Common Stock immediately prior to the Conversion (and after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split) of \none\n share of Common Stock for every 7.5 shares of Common Stock owned by such record holders. The Company\u2019s obligation to make the Settlement Payment was contingent on the Status Quo Order being lifted and the Company effecting the Charter Amendment. The defendants agreed to the settlement and the payment of the Settlement Payment solely to eliminate the burden, expense, and uncertainty of further litigation, and continue to expressly deny any liability or wrongdoing with respect to the matters alleged in the Shareholder Litigation. On April 3, 2023, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to lift the Status Quo Order.\nOn April 5, 2023, the court denied the motion to lift the Status Quo Order. \n124\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOn April 27, 2023, the parties jointly filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise, Settlement, and Release (the \u201cSettlement Stipulation\u201d) with the court, which fully memorialized the settlement that the parties agreed to in the term sheet. On June 29\u201330, 2023, the court held a settlement hearing to consider whether to approve the settlement as outlined in the Settlement Stipulation.\nOn July 21, 2023, the court issued an opinion which, citing issues with the scope of the release sought under the proposed settlement, declined to approve the settlement as presented. On July 22, 2023, the parties filed an addendum to the Settlement Stipulation in an effort to address the issues with the scope of the release raised by the court and requested that the court approve the settlement with the revised release set forth in the addendum. On July 24, 2023, the court requested additional submissions in relation to the proposed settlement. The Company provided the additional requested submissions to the court on July 26, 2023. \nOn August 11, 2023, the court approved the settlement of the Shareholder Litigation and lifted the Status Quo Order. On August 14, 2023, the Company filed the amendment to its Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, effective as of August 24, 2023, which was previously approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders at the special meeting held on March 14, 2023 to implement the Charter Amendments. The Reverse Stock Split occurred on August 24, 2023, the conversion of APEs into Common Stock occurred on August 25, 2023, and the Settlement Payment was made on August 28, 2023. On September 15, 2023, the Court entered an order dismissing the Shareholder Litigation in its entirety and with prejudice. On October 13, 2023, a purported Company stockholder who objected to the settlement of the Shareholder Litigation filed a notice of appeal from the order approving the settlement. As of January 26, 2024, the appeal was fully briefed before the Delaware Supreme Court.\nIn connection with the Settlement Payment, the Company recorded a $\n110.1\n million charge to other expense during the year ended December 31, 2023. The charge was based on the estimated fair value of $\n99.3\n million for the Settlement Payment and $\n10.8\n million of legal fees, net of probable insurance recoveries. The Company made the Settlement Payment on August 28, 2023, and recorded the disbursement to stockholders\u2019 deficit. The legal fee liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities or accounts payable within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. \nOn August 14, 2023, a putative class action on behalf of APE holders, captioned \nSimons v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.\n, C.A. No. 2023-0835-MTZ (the \u201cSimons Action\u201d), was filed against the Company in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The Simons Action asserts claims for a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and breach of contract, and alleges that the Settlement Payment in the Shareholder Litigation violates the Certificate of Designations that govern the APEs prior to the conversion of the APEs into Common Stock. On September 12, 2023, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On December 26, 2023, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which added a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. On February 16, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.\nOn May 4, 2023, the Company filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware against \nseventeen\n insurers participating in its directors & officers insurance program, seeking recovery for losses incurred in connection with its defense and settlement of the Shareholder Litigation, including the Settlement Payment. The insurance recovery action is captioned, \nAMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. v. XL Specialty Insurance Co., et al\n., Case No. N23C-05-045 AML CCLD (Del. Super. May 4, 2023) (the \u201cCoverage Action\u201d). In the suit, AMC seeks up to $\n80\n million in coverage under its Executive and Corporate Securities Liability Insurance Policies sold by the defendants, which provide coverage for the policy period of January 1, 2022, through January 1, 2023 (the \u201cPolicies\u201d) in excess of a $\n10\n million deductible. The primary insurer in the Coverage Action has paid its full $\n5\n million limit to reimburse the Company for its payment of the class counsel fee award. The remainder of the insurers contest whether they owe coverage for the Settlement Payment, claiming it does not constitute a \u201cLoss\u201d under their insurance policies. AMC may have claims for coverage from additional insurers as well, however, those insurers\u2019 policies contain mandatory arbitration provisions, so they have not been included in the Coverage Action.\nOn October 6, 2023, an action captioned \nMathew, et al. v. Citigroup Global Markets, et al.\n, Case No. 1:23-cv-12302-FDS (the \u201cMathew Action\u201d), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The Mathew Action names the Company as a nominal defendant. On November 16, 2023, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On January 9, 2024, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On January 11, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. On January 24, 2024, the Company filed an opposition to plaintiff\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint.\n125\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\u200b\nOn December 18, 2023, an action captioned \nMiller, et al. v. AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. et al.\n, C.A. No. 2023-1259-LM (Del. Ch.) (the \u201cMiller Action\u201d), was filed against the Company and two of its officers in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Plaintiffs in the Miller Action seek to inspect certain of the Company\u2019s books and records pursuant to 8 \nDel. C\n. \u00a7 220 in order to investigate allegations concerning alleged manipulation of the Company\u2019s Common Stock. On February 7, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation dismissing the Company\u2019s two officers from the action.\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNOTE 12\u2014FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\u200b\nFair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the entity transacts business.

To estimate the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment in Hycroft warrants, the Company valued the warrants using the Black Scholes pricing model. Such judgments and estimates included estimates of volatility of \n130.0%\n and discount rate of \n4.0%\n. The discount rate is based on the treasury yield that matches the term as of the measurement date. Other inputs included the term of \n3.2\n years, exercise price of $\n10.68\n and Hycroft\u2019s stock price at the date of measurement. The preceding exercise price has been adjusted for the one-for-ten reverse stock split Hycroft effectuated on November 15, 2023.

The Company has identified \ntwo\n reportable segments and reporting units for its theatrical exhibition operations, U.S. markets and International markets. The International markets reportable segment has operations in or partial interest in theatres in the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark. The Company divested of its interest in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania operations, see Note 1\n\u2014\nThe Company and Significant Accounting Policies for further information on the Baltics theatre sale. On January 24, 2023 the Company sold its interest in Saudi Arabia, see Note 6\n\u2014\nInvestments for additional information. Each segment\u2019s revenue is derived from admissions, food and beverage sales and other ancillary revenues, primarily screen advertising, loyalty membership fees, ticket sales, gift card income and exchange ticket income. The measure of segment profit and loss the Company uses to evaluate performance and allocate its resources is Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the reconciliation table below. The Company does not report asset information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate the performance of or allocate resources between segments.\nBelow is a breakdown of select financial information by reportable operating segment: \n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended \nRevenues (In millions)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2021\nU.S. markets\n\u200b\n$\n \n3,688.6\n\u200b\n$\n \n2,961.7\n\u200b\n$\n \n1,875.8\nInternational markets\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n1,124.0\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n949.7\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n652.1\nTotal revenues\n\u200b\n$\n \n4,812.6\n\u200b\n$\n \n3,911.4\n\u200b\n$\n \n2,527.9\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended \nAdjusted EBITDA (In millions)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2022\n\u200b\nDecember\u00a031, 2021\nU.S. markets\n\u200b\n$\n \n370.2\n\u200b\n$\n \n59.6\n\u200b\n$\n (\n250.6\n)\nInternational markets\n\u200b\n\u200b\n \n55.6\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (\n13.0\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n (\n41.1\n)\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA\n \n(1)\n\u200b\n$\n \n425.8\n\u200b\n$\n \n46.6\n\u200b\n$\n (\n291.7\n)\n(1)\nThe Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of its performance.

15\u2014LOSS PER SHARE\nOn August 4, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a special dividend of \none\n AMC Preferred Equity Unit for each share of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on August 15, 2022, the record date. The dividend was paid at the close of business on August 19, 2022 to investors who held Common Stock as of August 22, 2022, the ex-dividend date. Due to the characteristics of the AMC Preferred Equity Units, the special dividend had the effect of a stock split pursuant to ASC 505-20-25-4.\nOn August 24, 2023, the Company effectuated a reverse stock split at a ratio of \none\n share of Common Stock for every ten shares of Common Stock. As a result of the reverse stock split, each share of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock became convertible into ten shares of Common Stock, and by extension each AMC Preferred Equity Unit became equivalent to \none\n-tenth (1/10th) of a share of Common Stock. The reverse stock split did not impact the number of AMC Preferred Equity Units outstanding. The Company concluded that this change in conversion ratio is analogous to a reverse stock split of the AMC Preferred Equity Units even though the reverse stock split did not have an effect on the number of AMC Preferred Equity Units outstanding.\nAccordingly, all references made to share, per share, unit, per unit, or common share amounts in the accompanying financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect both the effects of the special dividend as a stock split and the subsequent reverse stock split. References made to AMC Preferred Equity Units have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of the reverse stock split on their equivalent Common Stock shares. \nBasic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share includes the effects of unvested RSUs with a service condition only and unvested contingently issuable RSUs and PSUs that have service and performance conditions, if dilutive.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted loss per common share:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n\u200b\nYear Ended\n(In millions)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2023\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2022\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nDecember\u00a031, 2021\nNumerator:\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nNet loss for basic and diluted loss per share\n\u200b\n$\n (\n396.6\n)\n\u200b\n$\n (\n973.6\n)\n\u200b\n$\n (\n1,269.1\n)\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nDenominator\n (shares in thousands):\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nWeighted average shares for basic and diluted loss per common share\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \n167,644\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \n104,769\n\u200b\n\u00a0\n \n95,482\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b\nBasic and diluted loss per common share:\n\u200b\n$\n (\n2.37\n)\n\u200b\n$\n (\n9.29\n)\n\u200b\n$\n (\n13.29\n)\n\u200b\nVested RSUs, PSUs, and SPSUs have dividend rights identical to the Company\u2019s Common Stock and are treated as outstanding shares for purposes of computing basic and diluted loss per share. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, unvested RSUs of \n272,469\n, \n252,336\n, and \n449,525\n, respectively, were not considered in the computation of diluted loss per share because they would be anti-dilutive.\nAll Tranche Year PSUs which had been granted at December 31, 2023, December 31, 2022, and December 31 2021 were included in basic loss per share for each respective period because the issuance of the related shares were contingent only upon the passage of time.

The Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated these disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K and have determined that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n\u200b\n(b)\nManagement\u2019s annual report on internal control over financial reporting.\n\u200b\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company as defined in Rule\u00a013a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. With management\u2019s participation, an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting was conducted as of December\u00a031, 2023, based on the framework and criteria established in \nInternal Control\u2014Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December\u00a031, 2023. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report in Item\u00a08 of Part\u00a0II of this Annual Report on Form\u00a010-K.\n\u200b\n(c)\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting.\n\u200b\nThere were no changes in its internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) during the quarter ended December\u00a031, 2023, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\n\u200b\n\u200b\nItem\u00a0\n9B.

Additionally, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. did not adopt or terminate any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement during the fourth quarter of 2023.\nAmendments to Bylaws\nOn February 22, 2024, the Company\u2019s board of directors adopted the Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the \u201cBylaws\u201d).  The Bylaws were amended to reflect, among other things, the following changes (capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Bylaws):\n\u25cf\nArticle II was revised to:\no\nreflect several changes to the meetings of the stockholders, including that (i) the Company may now postpone, reschedule, or cancel any annual meeting of stockholders previously scheduled by the Board; (ii) the advance notice provision for stockholder proposals (including nominations) was updated; and (iii) the time period for nominations/proposals to require a stockholder\u2019s notice was amended;\no\nclarify the ability of the Company to hold virtual meetings;\no\nupdate access to stockholder lists consistent with current provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (\u201cDGCL\u201d);\n134\n\n\nTable of Contents\no\nrevise the default vote for stockholder action to a majority of votes cast; and\no\nallow stockholders to file proxies electronically. \n\u25cf\nArticle III was revised to:\no\nremove the requirement that the Board meet at least four times per year in the United States;\no\nallow the Board to delegate full power and authority to committees; and\no\nclarify that the CEO may only preside over a meeting of the Board if the CEO is also a member of the Board.\n\u25cf\nArticle IV was revised to clarify that the Board appoints officers, but the CEO also can appoint Vice Presidents.\n\u25cf\nArticle V was revised to remove unnecessary sections.\n\u25cf\nArticle VII was revised to:\no\nupdate the general requirements for delivering notice to stockholders or directors to conform to current provisions of the DGCL; and\no\nconform the waiver of notice provisions to current provisions of the DGCL.\n\u25cf\nArticle IX was revised to update the Delaware forum selection provisions.\n\u200b\nThe foregoing description of the amendments to the Company\u2019s Bylaws does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.2 in unmarked form, and as Exhibit 3.2(a) in redline\u00a0form marked to show the changes described above, and are incorporated herein by reference.\nAnnual Meeting of Stockholders\nOn February 22, 2024, the Company\u2019s board of directors scheduled the Company\u2019s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders (the \u201c2024 Annual Meeting\u201d) for June 5, 2024, at 1:00 p.m. Central Time at the Company\u2019s Theatre Support Center located at One AMC Way, 11500 Ash Street, Leawood, Kansas 66211. The record date for the 2024 Annual Meeting will be April 11, 2024. The Company\u2019s 2023 Annual Meeting was postponed until November 8, 2023, in order to allow for the resolution of pending litigation. As disclosed in the proxy statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting, the Company is returning to a more normalized annual meeting schedule.\nIn the proxy statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting, the Company stated that, because the date of the 2024 Annual Meeting was expected to change by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of the 2023 Annual Meeting, it was disclosing a deadline for submission of stockholder proposals for inclusion in the proxy materials for the 2024 Annual Meeting (the \"2024 Proxy\") pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act (\"Rule\u00a014a-8\"). The Company informed stockholders that to be considered for inclusion in the 2024 Proxy, stockholder proposals submitted under Rule\u00a014a-8 must be in writing and received by the Corporate Secretary at the Company's principal offices at One AMC Way, 11500\u00a0Ash Street, Leawood, Kansas\u00a066211, no later than 5:00\u00a0pm Central Time on December\u00a031, 2023, which the Company determined to be a reasonable time before it expects to begin to print and send the 2024 Proxy.\nFurther, because the date of the 2024 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before the anniversary date of the 2023 Annual Meeting, in accordance with the advance notice provisions set forth in the Company's Bylaws, in order for a stockholder proposal submitted outside of Rule\u00a014a-8 or a director nomination submitted by a stockholder to be considered timely, it must be received no earlier than 120\u00a0days prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90\nth\n\u00a0day prior to such annual meeting or the 10\nth\n\u00a0day following the public announcement of the meeting date.\u00a0Accordingly, in order for a stockholder proposal to be submitted outside of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act or a director nomination submitted by a stockholder to be considered timely for the 2024 Annual Meeting, it must be received by the Corporate Secretary not later than March 9, 2024.\nIn addition to satisfying the foregoing requirements under the Company\u2019s Bylaws when an annual meeting is changed by more than 30\u00a0days from the anniversary of the prior annual meeting, to comply with the universal proxy rules, stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the Company\u2019s nominees must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule\u00a014a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than the close of business on the later of the 60th\u00a0day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th\u00a0day following the public announcement of the meeting date. Accordingly, to comply with the universal proxy rules, stockholders who intend to solicit proxies in support of director nominees other than the Company\u2019s nominees must provide notice that sets forth the information required by Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act no later than April 6, 2024.\n\u200b\n135\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCompensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers\nIn order to recognize the ongoing extraordinary efforts of the Company\u2019s management team as the theatrical exhibition industry continues to lag its pre-pandemic performance, encourage continued engagement, and incentivize executives during continued difficult business conditions, on February 22, 2024, the Compensation Committee of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cCommittee\u201d), in consultation with the Company\u2019s independent compensation consultant, approved modification of the performance goals for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, applicable to certain Performance Stock Units (\u201cPSUs\u201d) granted under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (\u201cEIP\u201d) to certain officers, including the named executive officers (\u201cNEOs\u201d) and certified achievement measured against such modified performance goals.  \nAs described in the Company\u2019s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A in connection with its 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, filed on September 29, 2023, each year the Committee approves annual grants under the EIP, half of which are designated as PSUs. The PSUs are divided into three equal tranches with each tranche allocated to a fiscal year during the three-year period covered by the grant (each a \u201cTranche Year\u201d). Each tranche is eligible to vest based upon attainment of certain financial performance goals during its applicable Tranche Year. The performance goals are established at the beginning of the applicable Tranche Year based upon the Company\u2019s financial plan, which in turn is highly dependent upon forecasts of overall industry box office. For the 2023 Tranche Year, primarily due to changes to studio movie release schedules in response to \nlengthy strikes by the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild\u2013American Federation of Television and Radio Artists\n which were outside the control of the Company, industry box office was significantly lower than the forecasts upon which the performance goals were predicated. As a result, PSUs allocated to the 2023 Tranche Year with unmodified Adjusted EBITDA performance goals would have vested at only 86% and those with unmodified Free Cash Flow performance goals vested at 0%.  The Committee determined that it was equitable to modify the 2023 Tranche Year performance goals to reflect actual industry conditions during the 2023 Tranche Year. After modification of the performance goals, the PSUs allocated to the 2023 tranche year with both adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow performance goals will vest at the maximum permitted level of 200%. Given the management team\u2019s continued focus on maximizing results despite industry factors outside its control, the Committee felt that the modifications were justified and consistent with the goals of the Company\u2019s executive compensation programs, namely to attract, retain, motivate and reward talented executives.\nThe table below reflects the incremental number of shares issuable to NEOs as a result of the modification of the performance goals  \nNEO\nCommon Stock\nAdam Aron\n187,476\nSean Goodman\n40,888\nDan Ellis\n17,634\nElizabeth Frank\n19,821\nKevin Connor\n15,650\n\u200b\nAs a result of the modification of the performance goals, in the first quarter of 2024 the Company estimates it will issue approximately 260,000 additional shares of Common Stock net of tax withholding, incur approximately $2.1 million of incremental stock compensation expense, and make estimated incremental cash payments of approximately $1.0 million to cover tax withholding.\n\u200b\n\u200b",
